"409140","412520"," To put the ing form after the preposition","Speaker 1"
"412520","418000"," This is negative language transfer things that are not the same between English and Spanish","Speaker 1"

"585660","586120"," Creo.","Speaker 1"
"586480","586800"," Yes.","Speaker 1"
"587020","592820"," So we get this situation occasionally in Spanish that the I form of two different verbs will look the same.","Speaker 1"
"593480","597960"," Creo of course could be from creer to believe or from crear to create.","Speaker 1"
"598300","599980"," So I don't believe.","Speaker 1"
"602220","602760"," No creo.","Speaker 2"
"603360","604300"," In arguing.","Speaker 1"
"604780","607560"," So to argue in Spanish you can use to discuss.","Speaker 1"
"607920","612720"," This is the most common verb actually that's used for argue.","Speaker 1"
"613360","615720"," Discuss is discutir.","Speaker 1"
"616200","616880"," Discutir.","Speaker 1"

"619520","620600"," Hablar mostly.","Speaker 1"
"620600","625780"," But you can use discutir as well for discuss but it has a heavy connotation mostly.","Speaker 1"
"626320","626420"," No?","Speaker 1"
"626760","631440"," I mean if you argue with your boyfriend or your girlfriend you use discutir.","Speaker 1"

"634960","635860"," Which is argue.","Speaker 1"
"636020","638980"," It means to argue a point rather than to get in an argument.","Speaker 1"
"639760","641760"," Discutir is more like to get in an argument.","Speaker 1"
"642420","644820"," So it's what we can call a first friend.","Speaker 1"
"645200","650800"," Words that look like they are the same but they have a difference in meaning and there are a few of them.","Speaker 1"
"651080","653740"," We need to watch out for them between English and Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"654100","656080"," Another example would be actual.","Speaker 1"
"656880","658300"," Which doesn't mean actual.","Speaker 1"
"658560","659340"," It means current.","Speaker 1"

"660720","661720"," Mi trabajo actual.","Speaker 1"
"662320","663360"," My current job.","Speaker 1"
"664140","668120"," Actualmente means currently at the moment rather than actually.","Speaker 1"
"668740","678180"," Mostly the vocabulary, the Latin English that we turn into Spanish is very reliable but there are a few words that we want to watch out for.","Speaker 1"
"678980","680200"," Discutir is one of them.","Speaker 1"
"680280","684080"," This doesn't really mean to discuss as much as it does to argue.","Speaker 1"
"684240","686320"," So I don't believe in arguing.","Speaker 1"
"687780","691260"," No creo en discutir.","Speaker 2"
"691460","691780"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"692200","693100"," In this way.","Speaker 1"
"693220","696700"," We would say of this way rather than in this way.","Speaker 1"
"698280","700100"," De esta forma.","Speaker 2"
"700320","700420"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"700560","704760"," So altogether I don't believe in arguing, in discussing in this way.","Speaker 1"
"706280","711840"," No creo en discutir de esta forma.","Speaker 2"
"712120","712440"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"712760","716200"," No creo en discutir de esta forma.","Speaker 1"
"716740","717100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"717620","737340"," So with this sentence, gracias por venir, we are reminded how we have two words for for, por and para and we need to have a think and decide which one we think is most appropriate before we translate for and that after prepositions we don't need to worry about making the ing form of the verb.","Speaker 1"
"737560","739000"," We just use the to form.","Speaker 1"
