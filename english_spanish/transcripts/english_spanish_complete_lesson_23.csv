"1740","8000"," So, I want us to run through the forms of ABER, this TO HAVE that we use to go into the past.","Speaker 1"
"8880","13860"," We said that we can remember them by looking at the two vowel sounds that we have inside the word ABER.","Speaker 1"
"14140","19100"," So give me I HAVE and WE HAVE. E and EMOS.","Speaker 1"
"19320","19560"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"19720","21840"," And give me the rest of the versions.","Speaker 1"
"24120","25820"," A, AS, AN.","Speaker 2"
"26200","26480"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"26480","31520"," We said that nouns ending A are feminine nouns.","Speaker 1"
"32460","36160"," So, for example, THE HOUSE, LA CASA.","Speaker 1"
"36760","43840"," So, words ending A are feminine, but words ending MA are masculine.","Speaker 1"
"44460","49200"," There's a small group of words that end MA which are masculine words.","Speaker 1"
"49260","53820"," For example, THE PROBLEM in Spanish is EL PROBLEMA.","Speaker 1"
"54500","55660"," EL PROBLEMA.","Speaker 1"
"55840","56300"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"56740","60780"," How would you say, HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM?","Speaker 1"
"61200","63660"," HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM?","Speaker 1"
"63800","64960"," For us to understand.","Speaker 1"
"67100","67780"," COMPRENDER.","Speaker 2"
"67940","68620"," COMPRENDER.","Speaker 1"
"68700","68840"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"68920","75180"," We can use COMPRENDER or we can use ENTENDER, but COMPRENDER is perfect here as well.","Speaker 1"
"75840","77680"," HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM?","Speaker 1"
"77840","81260"," And let's talk formally, TO USTED.","Speaker 1"
"82960","86160"," HAS UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM?","Speaker 2"
"86380","86480"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"86800","89400"," HAS UNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM?","Speaker 1"
"90300","90640"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"91140","95640"," So, a very common error for people learning Spanish is to say LA PROBLEMA.","Speaker 1"
"96040","103840"," Now, if we look at why these words ending MA are actually masculine, it's going to help us internalise it.","Speaker 1"
"104100","107100"," So, these words that end MA actually come from Greek.","Speaker 1"
"107860","109480"," PROBLEMA in Greek is PROBLEMA.","Speaker 1"
"110880","113720"," SYSTEM in Greek is SYSTEMA.","Speaker 1"
"114320","116620"," In Spanish, it's SISTEMA.","Speaker 1"
"117780","119000"," So, how would you say THE SYSTEM?","Speaker 1"
"120140","121180"," EL SISTEMA.","Speaker 2"
"122860","123440"," So, it's EL.","Speaker 1"
"123580","126040"," Now, in Greek, these words are neuter words.","Speaker 1"
"126120","128740"," In Greek, you have masculine, feminine and neuter.","Speaker 1"
"129360","132600"," And neuter words in Greek look like masculine words.","Speaker 1"
"133080","135120"," They have a similar word for THE.","Speaker 1"
"135620","137680"," They look kind of like masculine words.","Speaker 1"
"137680","143100"," So, when they went IN to Spanish or IN to Latin, they got mistaken as masculine words.","Speaker 1"
"143480","148220"," So, if we can identify them, there's a key group of words we can avoid committing this error with.","Speaker 1"
"148720","152700"," If it ends MA, it's probably from Greek and probably masculine.","Speaker 1"
"153160","154780"," So, how would you say THE SYSTEM again?","Speaker 1"
"156040","157060"," EL SISTEMA.","Speaker 2"
"158860","160720"," How would you say, HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE SYSTEM?","Speaker 1"
"161060","162000"," Talking informally.","Speaker 1"
"162160","163420"," HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE SYSTEM?","Speaker 1"
"165850","168130"," HAS ENTENDIDO EL SISTEMA?","Speaker 2"
"168130","168490"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"168930","170390"," HAS ENTENDIDO EL SISTEMA?","Speaker 1"
"170730","171110"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"171950","173370"," SENTIR in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"173730","175830"," SENTIR is TO FEEL.","Speaker 1"
"176370","177710"," Related to sensation.","Speaker 1"
"178390","180430"," So, SENTIR, TO FEEL.","Speaker 1"
"180650","184210"," And you can also use it like TO PERCEIVE in the sense of SMELL.","Speaker 1"
"184630","189050"," So, if you wanted to ask, for example, HAVE YOU FELT THE AROMA?","Speaker 1"
"189570","192830"," It would be a way of asking, HAVE YOU SMELLED THE AROMA?","Speaker 1"
"192990","193970"," HAVE YOU FELT IT?","Speaker 1"
"194330","195150"," So, how would you say that?","Speaker 1"
"195150","197570"," HAVE YOU FELT THE AROMA?","Speaker 1"
"199520","202900"," HAS SENTIDO EL AROMA?","Speaker 2"
"203520","203680"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"204220","206620"," HAS SENTIDO EL AROMA?","Speaker 1"
"206780","207220"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"207580","208640"," So, EL again.","Speaker 1"
"209400","210320"," So, we have EL.","Speaker 1"
"210760","223240"," EL PROBLEMA, EL SISTEMA, EL PROGRAMA, EL AROMA, EL PANORAMA, EL CLIMA, which is a little bit different in English, which means CLIMATE, EL CLIMA, and some others.","Speaker 1"
"224400","226420"," HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD THE PROGRAM?","Speaker 1"
"228520","231160"," HAS ENTENDIDO EL PROGRAMA?","Speaker 2"
"231320","231420"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"232040","233320"," Again, HOW WAS TO LOSE?","Speaker 1"
"233980","234620"," PERISHABLE.","Speaker 1"
"236660","237200"," PERDIR.","Speaker 2"
"237500","238000"," Close.","Speaker 2"
"238780","239180"," PERDER.","Speaker 2"
"239340","239680"," PERDER.","Speaker 1"
"239960","240280"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"240940","242300"," So, how would you say, I HAVE LOST?","Speaker 1"
"244060","245340"," HE PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"245440","245700"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"246320","249000"," Now, what if you wanted to emphasize, I HAVE LOST?","Speaker 1"
"250360","251880"," YO HE PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"251960","252280"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"252280","255959"," Now, if you want to say, I HAVE GOT LOST?","Speaker 1"
"256640","260339"," I'VE GOT LOST. You can just say, I'VE LOST MYSELF.","Speaker 1"
"260519","263280"," We said, I GET READY as I PREPARE MYSELF.","Speaker 1"
"263440","264460"," ME PREPARO.","Speaker 1"
"264680","267160"," We don't use this in Spanish, I GET READY.","Speaker 1"
"267360","268380"," You say, I READY MYSELF.","Speaker 1"
"269400","270200"," ME PREPARO.","Speaker 1"
"270500","276200"," So, you don't say, I GET LOST or I HAVE GOT LOST. You say, I HAVE LOST MYSELF.","Speaker 1"
"276700","277520"," So, how would you say that?","Speaker 1"
"279260","280060"," ME PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"280200","280520"," Again.","Speaker 1"
"281680","283440"," ME HE PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"283880","286640"," When you say it fluently, it doesn't actually sound any different.","Speaker 1"
"286980","289640"," Which is why I asked for it again, to make sure that you are putting it.","Speaker 1"
"289820","294420"," Because the E of ME and the E of E will blend together.","Speaker 1"
"294780","295520"," ME PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"297060","304920"," So, that means, I HAVE LOST MYSELF or I'VE GOT LOST. Now, what if you wanted to be emphatic as well and say, I HAVE LOST MYSELF?","Speaker 1"
"306140","307720"," YO ME HE PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"307760","308020"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"308260","309520"," YO ME HE PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"309520","312540"," How is YOU HAVE LOST?","Speaker 1"
"312780","314120"," Speaking informally.","Speaker 1"
"316270","317190"," AS PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"317270","317610"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"317870","318670"," AS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"318910","328870"," We said that the word for YOU, in the sense of YOU LOSE, YOU SEE, not I SEE YOU, but YOU SEE, is TU for informal YOU.","Speaker 1"
"329030","329190"," TU.","Speaker 1"
"329410","329530"," TU.","Speaker 1"
"330530","333870"," So, how would you say, YOU HAVE LOST?","Speaker 1"
"334190","335470"," Being emphatic.","Speaker 1"
"337030","338610"," TU HA PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"338610","340590"," There's a bit of a contradiction there.","Speaker 1"
"340750","342410"," TU HAS PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"342450","342730"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"342930","344270"," TU HAS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"344410","344670"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"345470","352670"," So, just as ME can mean ME or MYSELF, TE can mean YOU or YOURSELF.","Speaker 1"
"353350","355870"," So, how would you say, YOU HAVE GOT LOST?","Speaker 1"
"356390","357670"," YOU HAVE LOST YOURSELF?","Speaker 1"
"358790","359910"," TE HAS PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"359990","360250"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"360670","361830"," TE HAS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"362050","362890"," TE HAS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"363030","365090"," And what if you wanted to be emphatic as well?","Speaker 1"
"366490","368030"," TU TE HAS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"368030","368390"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"368770","371770"," TU TE HAS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"372130","372690"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"373710","376310"," What was WE HAVE from HABER?","Speaker 1"
"377850","378270"," HEMOS.","Speaker 1"
"378510","378990"," HEMOS.","Speaker 1"
"379210","379550"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"382550","383550"," WE HAVE LOST IT.","Speaker 1"

"388430","389790"," LO HEMOS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
"390110","393890"," Now, how would you say, WE HAVE LOST OURSELVES or WE'VE GOT LOST?","Speaker 1"
"396250","398570"," NOS HEMOS PERDIDO.","Speaker 2"
"398570","398990"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"399410","401510"," NOS HEMOS PERDIDO.","Speaker 1"
