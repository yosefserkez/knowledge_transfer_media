"1740","25120"," So how was To like or we said that the translation that we would give it in Spanish was to please or to be pleasing to Me gusta so the true version Gustar gustar good So, how would you say we like it and we want to take the root of the literal translation.","Speaker 1"
"25260","39430"," So it is pleasing to us nos gustamos So remember the first place you want your thoughts to go this is very important Well to gustar becomes gustamos.","Speaker 1"
"39850","42010"," It is pleasing to us.","Speaker 1"
"42530","49000"," So it is pleasing gusta, yes Nos gusta.","Speaker 1"
"49260","49820"," Nos gusta.","Speaker 1"
"50660","54760"," We were saying that gustar we can translate as to please or to be pleasing","Speaker 1"
"55460","59940"," Now it would probably make more sense for us to store it as to be pleasing","Speaker 1"
"59940","67460"," Because if we want to say something like she likes it what we will say is it is pleasing to","Speaker 1"
"68060","68700"," her","Speaker 1"
"69300","72580"," So we have the to her with gustar","Speaker 1"
"72580","80440"," So that's why it makes more sense to translate it as it is pleasing to her rather than it pleases her this way","Speaker 1"
"80440","82980"," We store this idea of to","Speaker 1"
"83700","85320"," So what is to her?","Speaker 1"
"86700","95800"," Le Good so we have la for her and to her le so if you want to say it is pleasing to her or she likes It how would it be?","Speaker 1"
"97180","109000"," Le gusta and it is pleasing to them or they like it Les gusta good les gusta you had a little battle there, right?","Speaker 1"
"109140","126540"," Yes, whether it was gustar or not good and you take control of that going it is pleasing gusta It is pleasing to them les gusta So with gustar we're not using lo and la and los and las we're using le and les They like it.","Speaker 1"
"126680","128800"," It is pleasing to them les gusta.","Speaker 1"
"129160","133140"," How would you say they like them or they are pleasing to them?","Speaker 1"
"134680","137780"," Les gusta good les gusta.","Speaker 1"
"138300","152340"," He likes them or they are pleasing to him Les gusta Very good So there are a couple of other verbs as well that we would prefer to give this kind of translation to what do you think?","Speaker 1"
"153280","159240"," interesar means interesar interesting Interesante is interesting.","Speaker 1"
"159420","161360"," What does interesar look like?","Speaker 1"
"162160","164640"," It might not be but what does it look like interesar?","Speaker 1"
"164820","166640"," What type of word does it look like?","Speaker 1"
"166960","174840"," So it's to interest good to interest Good, so this helps us with comprehension as well understanding.","Speaker 1"
"175440","179060"," What are our types of words and what they tend to look like?","Speaker 1"
"179880","185340"," so we could translate it as to interest or we could translate it as to be interesting too and","Speaker 1"
"185940","193840"," Here in this case is another verb like gustar that it makes more sense to translate it for ourselves as to be interesting too","Speaker 1"
"193840","196760"," Because it goes with le and not lo","Speaker 1"
"196760","202780"," So in our minds this fits then in the Spanish structure if we save that","Speaker 1"
"202780","209520"," Translation as to be interesting to rather than to interest so how would you say it interests me?","Speaker 1"
"210100","221140"," It is interesting to me Me interesa good me interesa Does it interest you let's speak informally does it interest you?","Speaker 1"
"222920","224000"," Te interesa?","Speaker 2"
"225260","226780"," Doesn't it interest you?","Speaker 1"
"228220","229720"," No te interesa.","Speaker 2"
"230080","230960"," No te interesa.","Speaker 1"
"231380","232680"," Why doesn't it interest you?","Speaker 1"
"234140","235620"," Por que no te interesa.","Speaker 2"
"235840","251440"," Good por que no te interesa So if we want to say it interests him what we were what we're really saying is it is interesting to him So we want to him here, so how would you say that it interests him or it's interesting to him?","Speaker 1"
"253460","254300"," Le interesa.","Speaker 2"
"254580","263880"," Good le interesa They're interested in it, it's interesting to them Les interesa.","Speaker 1"
"264040","265620"," Good les interesa.","Speaker 1"

"280880","283780"," Does it interest her to dance tonight?","Speaker 1"
"286480","290520"," Le interesa bailar esta noche.","Speaker 2"

"306720","309100"," Does it interest her to go out to dance tonight?","Speaker 1"
"309120","311520"," So let's go from the beginning does it interest her?","Speaker 1"
"313280","314400"," Le interesa.","Speaker 2"
"314660","319400"," Good le interesa and of course le interesa could mean does it interest her does it interest him?","Speaker 1"
"319560","320720"," Does it interest you formal?","Speaker 1"
"321100","329900"," We don't know by the le Le interesa to go out to dance tonight Salir a bailar esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"330100","345200"," Good so here we have a because salir is a verb of coming and going Le interesa salir a bailar esta noche Now what if you wanted to ask would it interest you would it be interesting to you informally?","Speaker 1"
"345640","349300"," So what was our sound for would that we add on to the true form of the verb?","Speaker 1"
"349720","351180"," What's our key sound for would?","Speaker 1"
"352360","353980"," Yeah, yeah, good.","Speaker 1"
"354420","355920"," Would it interest you?","Speaker 1"
"357880","377200"," Interaría slower Interesar Interesaría Interesaría good Another verb like this is a parecer parecer which is to seem but in English we already put to It seems to me.","Speaker 1"
"377420","378880"," It seems to him.","Speaker 1"
"379100","400600"," So how do you say it seems to me parecer is to seem it seems to me Before you change a verb there's something very quick and very essential that you must do You must go back to your to your takeoff point which is in the true form and make a quick check But I said ever okay.","Speaker 1"
"400600","404720"," I know I am I know what I'm doing Me parece me parece.","Speaker 1"
"404980","406080"," It seems to me.","Speaker 1"
"406400","411200"," It seems to me that what is this that that we put here same as what?","Speaker 1"
"412480","419900"," Yeah, okay Spanish kind of highlights for you that what is the question version of that?","Speaker 1"
"419900","437560"," It kind of shows you that much more clearly than English does but English shows you it as well if you think in English if you take the word that and you get rid of the T and you replace it with a W you get what in the same way that if you take the word there?","Speaker 1"
"437880","459580"," and you get rid of the T and you replace it with a W you get where or if you take the Word then and get rid of the T and replace it with a W you get when so you have care for that And then care for what same word so it seems to me that Me parece.","Speaker 1"
"460260","463580"," Yeah, he doesn't want to go out tonight.","Speaker 1"
"463680","479780"," He doesn't want to go out tonight No quiere Salir esta noche good me parece que no quiere salir esta noche good How would you say it seems to me that he doesn't like it?","Speaker 1"

"487600","490560"," It seems to me that he doesn't like it.","Speaker 1"
"490680","516679"," It's optional But in Spanish is obligatory you want to put this that and actually it's really gonna help you Think out your sentences to put that always So it seems to me that he doesn't like it Me parece que no lo gusta Le no le gusta good You might want to say me parece bien That would mean it seems good to me.","Speaker 1"
"516780","522380"," It seems fine to me, but we're not using the word good We're using the word well bien me parece bien.","Speaker 1"
"522460","533560"," It seems to me well You'll find a little gray area between English and Spanish about when we say good bueno, and when we say well bien But it's something you will pick up listening.","Speaker 1"
"533680","537180"," So here you would say well, it seems well to me.","Speaker 1"
"537200","543040"," It seems good to me Me parece bien good me parece bien.","Speaker 1"
"543160","563120"," It doesn't seem good to me No me parece bien good no me parece bien it doesn't seem good to her to him or to you for me No le parece bien good now, let's make it a question doesn't it seem okay to you No le parece bien good no le parece bien.","Speaker 1"

"592980","599060"," Inside a verb in English we can change that pose to poner and we get the verb in Spanish","Speaker 1"
"599060","605840"," So for example to compose in Spanish is componer and this com is actually con","Speaker 1"
"605840","612340"," The N changes next to the P so it literally means with putting to compose is with putting putting together","Speaker 1"
