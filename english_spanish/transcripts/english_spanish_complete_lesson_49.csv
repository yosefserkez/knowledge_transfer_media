"1930","8950"," To call in Spanish, so to call to somebody and also to make a phone call is llamar.","Speaker 1"
"10490","16030"," LL and we said this double L creates a y sound in most Spanish dialects just like the Y.","Speaker 1"
"19990","28030"," Good and we said that in Spanish you don't tend to say my name is or I am called you say I call","Speaker 1"
"28030","32330"," to introduce yourself so how would you say I call myself","Speaker 1"
"35350","42350"," good and if you want to ask somebody what their name is you can say how do you call yourself","Speaker 1"
"42350","47430"," so let's do this informally how do you call yourself what was the word for how","Speaker 1"

"111260","120160"," tein that we get inside various English verbs or Latin English verbs like contain contain is","Speaker 1"
"120160","126600"," so we have this trick using tener that we can convert over some more verbs from English","Speaker 1"
"126600","129979"," so doing the same with obtain we would get","Speaker 1"
"133140","135760"," maintain changed a little bit","Speaker 1"
"139580","146480"," and we said that man actually is like from mano hand sustain and this one changed a little bit as","Speaker 1"

"230160","235120"," good so altogether I used to have four but now I don't have any left","Speaker 1"
"236430","245050"," tenía cuatro pero ahora no me queda good tenía cuatro pero ahora no me queda","Speaker 2"
"245050","251410"," or pero ahora no me quedan you could use either so we're not using have","Speaker 1"
"251410","256529"," to give this meaning you have left how was I have in the present","Speaker 1"
"258190","263370"," and how did you make that I have to I have to in the sense of I must","Speaker 1"

"361190","368230"," tense there are very few irregularities in this tense it's a very safe tense and the irregularities","Speaker 1"
"368230","374850"," that we have are with very small verbs for example ver how was I see from ver","Speaker 1"
"377070","384890"," veo the same irregularity that we get in the I form in the present veo we get it in this line","Speaker 1"
"384890","390790"," in the past so instead of taking off error and putting o we ended up with this extra e","Speaker 1"
"391510","399770"," so they are is I was seeing I used to see he was seeing he used to see she was seeing she","Speaker 1"
"399770","405870"," used to see are you full moon they give me the the other versions then we were seeing","Speaker 1"

"415430","429630"," good another irregular verb in this tense is ser ser to be now the base for I he she it you formal","Speaker 1"
"429630","437130"," is era era now this is very easy to remember because we are looking at the past which is a","Speaker 1"
"437130","446930"," time and then era in English is a line in time in the past so we can just think of an era we would","Speaker 1"
"446930","454810"," use this with characteristic things so for example if you wanted to say I used to be a student what","Speaker 1"
"454810","460670"," was student estudiante good so how would you say I used to be a student","Speaker 1"
"464950","472510"," good we don't need the word for a good were you a student informally","Speaker 1"

"501560","504340"," good what were they what were they","Speaker 1"
"508900","516600"," good and then the last one of course that is irregular in this tense is ear ear to go now","Speaker 1"
"516600","525100"," I was going is kind of like a blend of the two different ways we have of creating this past","Speaker 1"
"525100","533140"," abba and ia I was going is iba so you see we got a bit of ia and a bit of abba with ear","Speaker 1"
"533140","539080"," I was going from to go iba so you can give me the other versions we were going","Speaker 1"

"571120","575740"," can use it in this way as well which is very common so how would you say I was going to call","Speaker 1"
"575740","584460"," you and we are talking informally I was going to call you iba jamarte there's something missing","Speaker 1"
"587360","592060"," I was I was going what kind of verb is going","Speaker 2"
"596040","600400"," good I was going to do it","Speaker 1"
"604440","610840"," good and I'm not sure here if you're putting the ah to connect the verbs if I did it yeah no I","Speaker 1"

"615160","615620"," good","Speaker 2"

"621760","623340"," all of those three as","Speaker 1"
"625040","630420"," will blend together so that's why I wasn't sure if you said it or not we were going to do it or make","Speaker 1"
