"650","17910"," To do or to make in Spanish is hacer and it has a silent h it's h-a-c-e-r so in most of Spain actually that would sound ather but hacer in most of the Spanish-speaking world.","Speaker 1"
"18810","19910"," What verb type is it?","Speaker 1"
"20110","20790"," What is the ending?","Speaker 1"
"21190","24990"," er verb so actually whenever we come across a new verb","Speaker 1"
"24990","31270"," we want to make a mental note what is the ending or rather than make a mental note just process it","Speaker 1"
"31270","37550"," remember we always want to do anything but memorize so just looking like hacer er verb okay just to","Speaker 1"
"37550","42170"," get in that habit if we know it's an er verb we know how to work with it so how would you say","Speaker 1"
"42170","48790"," he's doing or making she is doing or making you are formal doing or making","Speaker 1"
"51870","54010"," good you're doing it","Speaker 1"
"56780","61060"," how would you say they're doing it or you guys are doing it","Speaker 1"
"65140","67220"," very good very good","Speaker 1"
"70300","76160"," you informal are doing it so what is the sound for informal you","Speaker 1"
"76720","83060"," hacer so for informal you we add on an s to the he she version so we get","Speaker 1"
"84660","85700"," you're doing it","Speaker 1"
"87880","94380"," good the word for what in Spanish is que how would you say what are you doing","Speaker 1"
"97300","103900"," and this is a way of saying how are you as well what are you doing what are you up to good so","Speaker 1"
"103900","112200"," we see that for our verbs we have the principal sound of a and then we add our n or s and for","Speaker 1"
"112200","119720"," they or you plural and s for informal you and for our ear verbs we have the key sound e and we're","Speaker 1"
"119720","127639"," adding on s for informal you and for they you plural now these associations between s and","Speaker 1"
"127639","134100"," informal you and n and they or you guys we're going to see all throughout the Spanish verb","Speaker 1"
"134100","140000"," structure so i'm this confuses me a little bit isn't this also a memorization having to remember","Speaker 2"
"140000","148580"," which ending goes with what there's a difference between memorization and remembering ah we're","Speaker 1"
"148580","153160"," going to remember through not actively trying to memorize so i'm not telling you you shouldn't","Speaker 1"
"153160","157880"," remember anything you need to remember Spanish i'm telling you that you're going to remember it","Speaker 1"
"157880","162400"," much easier without the active process of trying to memorize anything which blocks","Speaker 1"
"162400","167880"," whichever processes we need for remembering i like to describe it in this way that you borrow","Speaker 1"
"167880","173020"," information when you memorize it but when you are applying it practically in this construction of","Speaker 1"
"173020","177580"," these sentences when you are looking from many different angles at the elements that we're","Speaker 1"
"177580","182160"," looking at in Spanish then you are internalizing it then it's really yours you're not borrowing it","Speaker 1"
"183600","188860"," puedo in Spanish means i can i am able","Speaker 1"
"190880","193820"," good p u e d o","Speaker 1"
"195580","199900"," you're probably noticing as well that the d is quite soft when it comes in the middle of a word","Speaker 1"
"199900","209400"," in Spanish rather than a hard d puedo so puedo means i can or i am able and the to form of the","Speaker 1"
"209400","218280"," verb so puedo is an air verb so how would you say he can or she can or it can or you formally can","Speaker 1"
"220260","223680"," and how would you say informally you can","Speaker 1"
"226060","232900"," good now in English we don't say can you to come that's what we mean now this is an English","Speaker 1"
"232900","238140"," problem the English is taking the to away here it does it sometimes you don't say i must to come","Speaker 1"
"238140","244060"," say i must come no it's like i am able to come you can think of it this way as we thought of i","Speaker 1"
"244060","250080"," must come as i owe to come so how would you say can you come talking informally","Speaker 1"
"255350","261650"," so this is what we're going to be using to talk with friends know this s we're going to be hearing","Speaker 1"
"261650","266350"," it a lot if it helps you make the association you might have heard como estas how are you","Speaker 1"
"266350","270170"," the s on the end of estas there is this informal s","Speaker 1"
"271950","273690"," so can't you come","Speaker 1"
"276470","277950"," why can't you come","Speaker 1"
"281370","283890"," i want to know why you can't come","Speaker 1"
"285670","291630"," oh to know um okay i'm going to know and knowledge and that's not taking me anywhere","Speaker 2"
"291630","296170"," boys got savvy ah yes so i want to know","Speaker 1"
"302330","304770"," why you can't come","Speaker 1"
"307150","313770"," very good very good if we address each part part by part and apply all of our mentored energy just","Speaker 1"
"313770","319210"," to the part we need and then forget it very good","Speaker 1"
"320590","328890"," so to recap we have our verbs and we have our ear verbs for all of the verbs we take off the ending","Speaker 1"
"328890","336950"," are air here and we put o for the i version so when there is to sell and i sell is","Speaker 1"
"338330","343130"," vendo vendo comprar is to buy and i buy is","Speaker 1"
"345250","352090"," compro compro good yegar is to arrive yegar and i arrive is","Speaker 1"
"353990","361030"," yegaro yeah oh yego yego good so with this rule we can take any verb and we can do this","Speaker 1"
"361030","366110"," if it's regular maybe it's irregular and we try it and we make a mistake so for example salir","Speaker 1"
"366110","373090"," is to leave or to go out if we apply this rule what are we going to come up with salo salo but","Speaker 1"
"373090","380590"," it's wrong it's salgo so it's one of those go instead of or like vengo i'm coming tengo tengo","Speaker 1"
"380590","387570"," i have salgo i leave i'm going out they're quite common verbs we tend to find in all languages","Speaker 1"
"387570","395510"," that the most common verbs are the most irregular esperar esperar means to wait and to hope","Speaker 1"
"396110","401070"," which is interesting and it's accurate enough i mean you're not doing much more than waiting","Speaker 1"
"401070","408450"," when you hope we have in the word desperate actually this is un and you're hopeless when","Speaker 1"
"408450","414630"," you're desperate so esperar is to wait or to hope how do you say i'm waiting or i'm hoping or i wait","Speaker 1"
"414630","420410"," hope now how do you say he waits","Speaker 1"
"424250","428670"," i'm really glad you made that mistake actually because it's a it's a wonderful","Speaker 1"
"428670","435790"," point to elaborate on before we touch a verb we want to take one split second to go","Speaker 1"
"435790","447090"," verb otherwise what happens our brain is from and it wants to put an a what your mind is doing","Speaker 1"
"447090","453890"," there putting an e because you have s b and it fits better is actually even ingrained in other","Speaker 1"
"453890","458050"," languages for example in turkish you have something called vowel harmony and when you're adding on","Speaker 1"
"458050","463630"," suffixes there's like two or four depending on the suffix two or four different versions of that","Speaker 1"
"463630","468790"," suffix that you can add on so it can agree with the vowel before so there's something in your mind","Speaker 1"
"468790","474850"," that would prefer an e there of course because it's s b and like i said you even see this formalized","Speaker 1"
"474850","479690"," in other languages like in this phenomenon of vowel harmony so to stop that process from happening","Speaker 1"
"479690","488170"," you must run back to the to form and then you take control espera espera and espera means he she it","Speaker 1"
"488170","493430"," you form a wait or are waiting is waiting we can build the rest so how do you say they wait","Speaker 1"
"495750","499330"," if you want to say they're waiting for me we don't need the word for four","Speaker 1"
"499330","505430"," it's just like they await me we don't need the word for four so how do you say they await me","Speaker 1"
"509910","514510"," the only option there because it's a changed verb they're not waiting for me","Speaker 1"
"517850","521710"," good i want to know why they're not waiting for me i want to know","Speaker 1"
"524430","524910"," why","Speaker 1"
"533290","535990"," i was just very happy that i remembered","Speaker 2"
"535990","537990"," ah good finally","Speaker 2"
"541350","547130"," good isn't it from savvy yeah there is a gray area between v and b so it will change between","Speaker 1"
"547130","552510"," languages actually a very nice example of this is the word for vocabulary vocabulary in spanish is","Speaker 1"
"554510","558070"," it's spelled with a v but the word for mouth in spanish is","Speaker 1"
"558710","565150"," spelled with a b now of course is coming from your vocabulary is your mouth","Speaker 1"
"565990","574510"," gives us another role actually words ending ari will become ario so necessary necessary contrary","Speaker 1"
"575590","576730"," contrario good","Speaker 2"
