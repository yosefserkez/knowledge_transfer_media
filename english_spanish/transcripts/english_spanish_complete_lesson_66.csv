"28740","32820"," Another example would be how we refer to body parts in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"33400","38380"," So you don't say in Spanish, for example, my leg hurts.","Speaker 1"

"84900","85520"," You don't say that.","Speaker 1"
"85600","87000"," You say it hurts me the leg.","Speaker 1"
"87540","88660"," It hurts me the leg.","Speaker 1"
"88800","89920"," So leg is pierna.","Speaker 1"

"96560","96820"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"97240","98400"," Me dole la pierna.","Speaker 1"
"98980","104300"," If you want to say my leg doesn't hurt anymore, you can just use more for anymore.","Speaker 1"
"104480","105540"," So what was more again?","Speaker 1"
"107240","107620"," Mas.","Speaker 1"
"107760","108080"," Mas.","Speaker 1"
"108560","110900"," So my leg doesn't hurt anymore.","Speaker 1"
