"1990","8990"," The dinner in Spanish is la cena, spelled C-E-N-A, la cena.","Speaker 1"
"9810","11210"," La cena, la cena.","Speaker 2"
"11450","16550"," Those in Spain will pronounce la cena, so la cena, the dinner.","Speaker 1"
"17130","25870"," Now to dine, which doesn't sound formal in Spanish as it does in English, to dine, you just make la cena into a verb.","Speaker 1"
"26330","27930"," So how do you think that would sound?","Speaker 1"
"29790","30270"," Cenar.","Speaker 1"
"30430","31150"," Cenar, good.","Speaker 1"
"31270","32570"," So cenar is to dine.","Speaker 1"
"33130","37810"," So how would you say, I was dining, or more naturally in English, I was having dinner?","Speaker 1"
"39890","40370"," Cenaba.","Speaker 1"
"40710","41630"," Good, cenaba.","Speaker 1"
"42030","45390"," Now apart from I was having dinner, what else can that mean, cenaba?","Speaker 1"
"47540","50260"," He, she, it were having dinner.","Speaker 2"
"50620","51520"," And who else?","Speaker 1"
"52640","53120"," Euphomo.","Speaker 2"
"53460","53720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"54120","56340"," So we have all of those meanings there with the aba.","Speaker 1"
"56340","62180"," So for this line in the past, we have aba for R verbs.","Speaker 1"
"62500","70700"," We are taking off our R and we are putting aba as our key sound, and then we are adding on moss or N or S.","Speaker 1"
"71420","76880"," Quemar, Q-U-E-M-A-R, quemar in Spanish is to burn.","Speaker 1"
"77720","78300"," Quemar.","Speaker 1"
"78420","79440"," Quemar, good.","Speaker 1"
"80420","82560"," How would you say, he was burning the dinner?","Speaker 1"
"83040","84400"," He was burning the dinner.","Speaker 1"
"86700","87840"," Quemaba la cena.","Speaker 2"
"88140","89480"," Good, quemaba la cena.","Speaker 1"
"90220","95740"," And if you wanted to show that it was he that was burning the dinner, how would you do that?","Speaker 1"
"97200","98000"," Just el.","Speaker 2"
"98460","100360"," El quemaba la cena.","Speaker 2"
"100600","104600"," Good, and if you wanted to show that it was you, woman, you were burning the dinner?","Speaker 1"
"106900","108640"," Usted quemaba la cena.","Speaker 2"
"108860","109020"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"109220","111240"," Usted quemaba la cena.","Speaker 1"
"111900","112120"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"112920","115840"," So, el quemaba la cena.","Speaker 1"
"116420","120300"," He was burning, and then we say what he was burning, the dinner.","Speaker 1"
"120940","131040"," If we want to say the dinner was burning, the dinner was getting burned, we can't just say la cena quemaba, because we are waiting to hear what was the dinner burning.","Speaker 1"
"131040","132820"," It feels incomplete.","Speaker 1"
"133740","143320"," So, if you want to just say the dinner was burning, like the dinner was getting burned, in Spanish we are going to say the dinner was burning itself.","Speaker 1"
"143960","145180"," What is itself?","Speaker 1"
"147120","147380"," Se.","Speaker 2"
"147600","148020"," Se.","Speaker 1"
"148500","155160"," So, how would you say the dinner was burning, the dinner was getting burned, the dinner was burning itself?","Speaker 1"
"156460","159020"," La cena se quemaba.","Speaker 2"
"159300","159760"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"160420","160860"," That's it.","Speaker 1"
"161500","162960"," La cena se quemaba.","Speaker 1"
"163360","163620"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"164400","166460"," The position of la cena is also flexible.","Speaker 1"
"167280","172100"," You can say la cena se quemaba, or you can put la cena afterwards.","Speaker 1"
"172640","173260"," How would that be?","Speaker 1"
"174240","177300"," Se quemaba la cena.","Speaker 1"
"177880","182880"," So, it's flexible, unlike in English, because in English, well, we don't really change verbs so much.","Speaker 1"
"183260","187880"," There's not so many grammatical resources in English as there are in Spanish, for example.","Speaker 1"
"188240","193920"," So, in English, the word order is much more important than in Spanish to show what's going on.","Speaker 1"
"194180","198500"," So, we can say la cena se quemaba, or se quemaba la cena.","Speaker 1"
"198500","202580"," Because we have se, we understand that the dinner was getting burned.","Speaker 1"
"203180","204860"," There was nobody else there involved.","Speaker 1"
"206000","214360"," If you want to say I burn, like in the sun, in the sense of, you know, I get burnt, you're also going to use this structure.","Speaker 1"
"215280","218640"," You're going to say I burn myself in the sun.","Speaker 1"
"218760","220800"," Now, you understand you're not burning yourself.","Speaker 1"
"221400","223220"," It just means I get burnt.","Speaker 1"
"223220","227720"," So, sun is sol, in was en.","Speaker 1"
"228280","232100"," So, I get burnt, I burn in the sun.","Speaker 1"
"232200","232840"," How would that be?","Speaker 1"
"232940","233840"," And sun is masculine.","Speaker 1"
"236340","238500"," Me quemo en el sol.","Speaker 2"
"238860","239200"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"239440","241080"," Me quemo en el sol.","Speaker 1"
"241620","250280"," You can't just say quemo en el sol, because this would mean that I burn something in the sun, and we would be waiting to hear what you burn in the sun.","Speaker 1"
"250280","252120"," Me quemo en el sol.","Speaker 1"
"252780","261640"," If you want to say the sun burns me, this is another way you could put the sentence, and there we are not using this self structure.","Speaker 1"
"261900","268120"," Because we have the sun burns, and then we have me telling us what it burns, so it's complete.","Speaker 1"
"268620","269440"," So, how would you say that?","Speaker 1"
"269500","270520"," The sun burns me.","Speaker 1"
"272800","274200"," El sol me quema.","Speaker 2"
"274400","274740"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"275180","277540"," El sol me quema, me quema el sol.","Speaker 1"
"277940","278460"," Either way.","Speaker 1"
"278460","283460"," Another example of a verb like this is romper.","Speaker 1"
"284040","284640"," Romper.","Speaker 1"
"285060","287320"," Romper means, maybe you can guess it.","Speaker 1"
"287360","288540"," What do you think romper means?","Speaker 1"
"289640","293180"," It's quite obscure, the connection, but you might find it.","Speaker 1"
"294880","295480"," Rapcha?","Speaker 1"
"296220","296680"," To break.","Speaker 1"
"296860","297400"," To break.","Speaker 1"
"298140","299520"," Romper, to break.","Speaker 1"
"300180","302600"," So, how would you say I break?","Speaker 1"
"304120","304720"," Rompo.","Speaker 2"
"305000","306420"," Rompo, with a P.","Speaker 1"
"306620","307080"," Rompo.","Speaker 1"
"307080","308760"," I break it.","Speaker 1"
"309820","311260"," Lo rompo.","Speaker 2"
"311640","312300"," Lo rompo.","Speaker 1"
"312640","312900"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"313240","314280"," I break it.","Speaker 1"
"314920","320800"," If you want to say it breaks, like it gets broken, it breaks all the time.","Speaker 1"
"321500","325280"," All the time means todo el tiempo.","Speaker 1"
"325840","327040"," Literally, all.","Speaker 1"
"327300","328900"," Todo el tiempo.","Speaker 1"
"329140","329580"," The time.","Speaker 1"
"329760","332120"," Todo, T-O-D-O, is all.","Speaker 1"
"332120","334520"," So, it breaks all the time.","Speaker 1"
"334680","335960"," It breaks itself.","Speaker 1"
"336400","338640"," It gets broken all the time.","Speaker 1"
"338860","339620"," How would you say that?","Speaker 1"
"339660","340640"," It breaks all the time.","Speaker 1"
"342520","344180"," Se rompa todo.","Speaker 2"
"344700","353420"," The se got your attention, so you forgot to do something very important, which was to quickly go back to the to form and be clear on what type of verb you're working with.","Speaker 1"
"354420","356800"," Se rompe todo el tiempo.","Speaker 2"
"357020","357120"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"357440","359580"," Se rompe todo el tiempo.","Speaker 1"
"359960","361600"," It breaks all the time.","Speaker 1"
"361960","363840"," So, here we understand that it gets broken.","Speaker 1"
"364080","364520"," It breaks.","Speaker 1"
"364540","365260"," It breaks itself.","Speaker 1"
"366060","368000"," How would you say they break all the time?","Speaker 1"
"369640","370380"," It's rompen.","Speaker 2"
"371680","374940"," Se rompen todo el tiempo.","Speaker 2"
"375460","377840"," Se rompen todo el tiempo.","Speaker 1"
"378060","378920"," They break themselves.","Speaker 1"
"378920","382360"," Not literally that they are breaking themselves, just they get broken.","Speaker 1"
"382580","386620"," We don't have this get in Spanish and this is how we get around it.","Speaker 1"
"387320","388180"," What was tonight?","Speaker 1"
"390040","391560"," Esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"391860","395320"," So, we said esta is this for feminine words.","Speaker 1"
"395720","396500"," Esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"397460","400260"," What was this for masculine words?","Speaker 1"
"400340","401520"," How did we say this car?","Speaker 1"
"403260","404360"," Este auto.","Speaker 2"
"404620","405660"," Este auto.","Speaker 1"
"405940","406940"," Este coche.","Speaker 1"
"407240","407460"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"407460","410020"," So, este is this for masculine words.","Speaker 1"
"410540","415060"," And we have the e of el, like el auto, in este.","Speaker 1"
"415320","416180"," Este auto.","Speaker 1"
"416780","421240"," These cars are estos autos.","Speaker 1"
"421840","426140"," So, we go from este to estos for the plural.","Speaker 1"
"426760","427780"," Not estes.","Speaker 1"
"428800","429680"," Estos.","Speaker 1"
"429820","431100"," Estos autos.","Speaker 1"
"432560","436660"," Now, this might look irregular but there is a logic there.","Speaker 1"
"436800","439080"," It's just different to the one that we might expect.","Speaker 1"
"439780","446720"," We have the e of el in este and we have the os of los in estos.","Speaker 1"
"447520","448860"," So, we have the car.","Speaker 1"
"450640","451260"," El coche.","Speaker 2"
"451660","451960"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"451960","453080"," And this car.","Speaker 1"
"454740","456180"," Este coche.","Speaker 2"
"456340","456640"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"457000","458000"," The cars.","Speaker 1"
"459360","460940"," Los coches.","Speaker 2"
"461120","462020"," Los coches.","Speaker 1"
"462220","463380"," And these cars.","Speaker 1"
"465020","466340"," Estos coches.","Speaker 1"
"466480","467340"," Estos coches.","Speaker 1"
"467540","471960"," So, we have os in los and estos and we have e in el and este.","Speaker 1"
"471960","478020"," All of those, you can make that and those now just by plucking out the t.","Speaker 1"
"478780","483820"," So, if este auto is this car, how do you say that car?","Speaker 1"
"484900","486920"," Ese auto.","Speaker 2"
"487640","493620"," If estos coches or estos autos are these cars, how would you say those cars?","Speaker 1"
"495140","496540"," Esos autos.","Speaker 1"
"496680","497760"," Esos autos.","Speaker 1"
"498120","498440"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"498440","501200"," So, how would you say those ones?","Speaker 1"
"501840","505200"," And for those ones you can just use this word for those.","Speaker 1"
"505780","509720"," And imagine me talking about masculine things or mixed things, things of mixed gender.","Speaker 1"
"510420","513200"," Those ones break all the time.","Speaker 1"
"513600","515440"," Those ones break all the time.","Speaker 1"
"517400","520360"," Esos rompen todo el tiempo.","Speaker 2"
"520940","523340"," So, now I'm waiting to hear what they break.","Speaker 1"
"524340","526640"," Esos rompen todo el tiempo.","Speaker 1"
"526640","528620"," What do they break all the time?","Speaker 1"
"529200","533800"," Esos se rompen todo el tiempo.","Speaker 2"
"534600","537640"," Esos se rompen todo el tiempo.","Speaker 1"
"537960","544900"," So, you'll have to listen out in Spanish for these verbs that want you to show it when the action isn't to something else.","Speaker 1"
"545720","548260"," It's transforming, not something else.","Speaker 1"
"548720","549960"," Se transforma.","Speaker 1"
"550540","551400"," It breaks.","Speaker 1"
"551500","553980"," It's breaking, not something else.","Speaker 1"
"554420","555440"," Se rompe.","Speaker 1"
"555440","560320"," It's changing, not something else, but here you don't need it.","Speaker 1"
"560800","561220"," Cambia.","Speaker 1"
"561460","562140"," From cambiar.","Speaker 1"
"562640","563140"," Cambia.","Speaker 1"
"563840","574180"," Being aware of that this occurs is enough and you will listen out and in real life get a conscious understanding and also an intuition about where we need to do this.","Speaker 1"
