"1220","8100"," Another place where we use this mood tense is when we are giving orders to each other.","Speaker 1"
"8460","16060"," Most of the time, with just one exception, which we will look at, we're using this mood tense to give orders.","Speaker 1"
"16700","27760"," For example, if you wanted to say informally, don't speak, you would just say, you don't speak, but you will put it in this mood tense.","Speaker 1"
"27980","29920"," So how would you say that, don't speak?","Speaker 1"
"32540","33480"," No hables.","Speaker 1"
"33860","34640"," No hables.","Speaker 1"
"34980","35080"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"35500","36400"," Don't speak.","Speaker 1"
"36780","37460"," No hables.","Speaker 1"
"38280","40540"," How would you say, don't stay?","Speaker 1"
"40880","41780"," Don't stay.","Speaker 1"
"41920","43480"," Still speaking informally.","Speaker 1"
"43940","49080"," So you need to say, you don't stay, and then you just switch the ending.","Speaker 1"
"49580","51320"," So let's build it up together.","Speaker 1"
"51380","52840"," How do you say, you don't stay?","Speaker 1"
"54300","55560"," No te quedas.","Speaker 2"
"59060","61820"," No te don't stay.","Speaker 1"
"62200","65180"," Then you will use this mood tense.","Speaker 1"
"67000","68240"," No te quedas.","Speaker 2"
"68360","69300"," No te quedas.","Speaker 1"
"69440","71380"," And then it sounds like, don't stay.","Speaker 1"
"71760","72400"," No te quedas.","Speaker 1"
"72660","73740"," Don't stay here.","Speaker 1"
"75260","76640"," No te quedas aquí.","Speaker 2"

"77320","78260"," No te quedas aquí.","Speaker 1"
"78480","88460"," The word for there is allí, allí, spelt A-H-I, and there also exists allí, spelt with double L.","Speaker 1"
"88820","97660"," There's a tiny, even imperceivable difference between allí, A-H-I, and allí, A-L-L-I.","Speaker 1"

"102540","103860"," No te quedas allí.","Speaker 1"

"120230","122490"," No lo des a él.","Speaker 2"

"154190","154750"," Comer.","Speaker 1"
"154930","155330"," Comer.","Speaker 1"

"159450","161730"," How would you tell more than one person to eat?","Speaker 1"
"164030","164430"," Coman.","Speaker 1"
"164670","165250"," Coman.","Speaker 1"
"165630","166030"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"174290","174890"," Esperen.","Speaker 1"
"175450","185770"," Now if you want to say, wait for me, we know already we don't use for, we just say me, me, with positive commands, with positive commands.","Speaker 1"
"185890","199190"," When you're telling somebody to do something, rather than not to do something, we have these literal words like mayor or law, breaking the rules that we learned so far about their position.","Speaker 1"
"199770","204010"," They will come after the changed verb, only with positive commands.","Speaker 1"
"204170","223690"," This helps our ear tune in to the fact that it's a command, because other than that vowel changing, which is a very small change, which might be quite hard to pick up audibly, we also have these small little words like mayor or law coming after the verb, and that also helps our ear tune in to the fact that it's a command.","Speaker 1"
"224090","232810"," So if you want to say to this more than one person, to this plural you, wait for me, await me, how will it sound?","Speaker 1"
"235150","235770"," Esperen me.","Speaker 2"
"236210","236870"," Esperen me.","Speaker 1"

"258769","260209"," This is a negative command.","Speaker 1"

"289150","289690"," No lo coma.","Speaker 1"

"310580","311240"," Very good.","Speaker 1"

"317980","318540"," Olvidar.","Speaker 1"
"318620","321200"," Related to oblivion in English actually.","Speaker 1"
"321320","325160"," Oblivion means like a state of complete forgetting.","Speaker 1"
"325840","329280"," So we can see the connection there between oblivion and olvidar.","Speaker 1"
"330060","330620"," Olvidar.","Speaker 1"
"330760","331200"," To forget.","Speaker 1"
"331640","333120"," Or olvidarse.","Speaker 1"
"333800","334140"," Either.","Speaker 1"
"334460","339780"," It can be either because olvidar is a verb where we need to say what is being forgotten.","Speaker 1"
"339960","340800"," We need to say it.","Speaker 1"
"341080","344060"," So if we use it, we have no problem.","Speaker 1"
"344340","345020"," Lo olvido.","Speaker 1"
"345020","352680"," But if you want to just say I forget, then we have a problem because we're not saying what, so we need to say I forget myself.","Speaker 1"
"353020","353980"," Me olvido.","Speaker 1"
"354460","356540"," So it's a verb that doesn't like to be alone.","Speaker 1"
"356860","358980"," So how would you say forget it?","Speaker 1"
"359380","360280"," Speaking formally.","Speaker 1"

"363680","364220"," Olvidelo.","Speaker 2"

"366080","366420"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"367080","373740"," Now if you just want to say forget, and we don't want to say it, this verb doesn't like to be alone.","Speaker 1"
"373740","375540"," So there we would say forget yourself.","Speaker 1"
"375720","376840"," So how would this be?","Speaker 1"
"377200","377860"," Still formally.","Speaker 1"

"397640","398240"," Don't forget.","Speaker 1"

"400980","402240"," No te olvides.","Speaker 1"
"402560","402660"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"402740","403860"," No te olvides.","Speaker 1"

"429060","429260"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"431460","432340"," You could put the both.","Speaker 1"
"432600","433960"," Meaning doesn't really change.","Speaker 1"
"434760","436780"," How would you say let's not forget it?","Speaker 1"
"437060","438100"," How do you think that would be?","Speaker 1"

"461240","461840"," Comprar.","Speaker 1"
"462420","463020"," Comprar.","Speaker 1"
"463380","471100"," How would you say to more than one person buy what is missing, what lacks, what is necessary?","Speaker 1"
"471380","474520"," So what was this missing, lacks, necessary verb?","Speaker 1"
"476620","477220"," Faltar.","Speaker 2"
"477340","477620"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"477800","478320"," Faltar.","Speaker 1"

"491390","491860"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"495060","496000"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"497700","504660"," You could also say, buy what is making lack.","Speaker 1"
"504900","506460"," You will hear that as well.","Speaker 1"
"507180","514380"," So we're using the mood tense to make commands with one exception.","Speaker 1"
"514960","519640"," The one exception is with positive informal commands.","Speaker 1"
"519960","527380"," So what that means is when we're speaking informally and we're telling somebody to do something rather than not to do something.","Speaker 1"
"527600","532420"," The reason why we don't use the mood tense here is because we want a shortcut.","Speaker 1"
"533040","537740"," It's what we do most to tell people informally what to do.","Speaker 1"
"538220","543180"," If you think about it all day, you're saying wait here, buy this, call me later, do that and the other.","Speaker 1"
"543280","549160"," It's such common speech that it seemed a bit heavy to use the mood tense for this.","Speaker 1"
"549560","557200"," So Spanish took a shortcut and the shortcut is just dropping the S of the U form of the verb.","Speaker 1"
"557280","560640"," So for example, we have comprar to buy.","Speaker 1"
"561100","565260"," You buy informally is compras.","Speaker 1"
"566080","575800"," Now to make the order, the positive order, we just drop the S and we get compra, which is the same as the he, she, it.","Speaker 1"
"575940","582260"," It's the same as the he, she, it form but it will never cause really any ambiguity for two reasons.","Speaker 1"
"582680","595380"," Firstly, your tone of voice when you're making an order, the context is always very present and also because we'll be putting our small words like la, me, la after the verb with the positive orders at least.","Speaker 1"
"595580","604420"," So it's very obviously an order but we want to think it through this way that we are taking off the S so we keep the association with U informal.","Speaker 1"
"604940","607300"," So we have to buy, comprar.","Speaker 1"
"607820","610180"," You buy informally, compras.","Speaker 1"
"610580","613540"," Now we want to make an order, we just get rid of the S and we say compra.","Speaker 1"
"614380","617120"," How would you say buy it, talking informally?","Speaker 1"
"619360","619920"," Compralo.","Speaker 2"
"620980","622100"," Buy me it.","Speaker 1"
"623920","624520"," Compramelo.","Speaker 2"

"637470","638250"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"666030","666990"," Nolo come.","Speaker 2"
