"260","12540"," So we were learning how we can use the present to talk about the past using haber, which is to have in sentences like I have gone, I have eaten.","Speaker 1"
"13100","16420"," What do you think terminar means?","Speaker 1"
"17120","17560"," Terminar.","Speaker 1"
"18840","20180"," To terminate.","Speaker 2"
"20840","25060"," And what verb would we use more commonly in English?","Speaker 1"
"26040","26680"," Finish.","Speaker 1"
"27460","28740"," Terminar is to finish.","Speaker 1"
"29480","32700"," Do you remember how to say I have from haber?","Speaker 1"
"33960","38880"," We can look at the two vowels we have in haber and this will set us off.","Speaker 1"
"39240","39900"," Ah, yes.","Speaker 2"
"40400","41740"," Okay, so I have.","Speaker 1"
"44070","45510"," Is it e or a?","Speaker 2"
"45690","46210"," It's e.","Speaker 1"
"46330","46850"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"47390","48410"," So we have?","Speaker 1"
"50240","50760"," Hemos.","Speaker 2"
"50960","51240"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"51340","52160"," How do you spell e?","Speaker 1"
"53860","54740"," H-E.","Speaker 1"
"54860","55720"," H-E, good.","Speaker 1"
"55780","59340"," And that H comes from haber, that silent H that you have there.","Speaker 1"
"59460","59640"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"59900","62380"," So how would you say I have finished?","Speaker 1"
"62820","64319"," Firstly, how do you make finished?","Speaker 1"
"64540","67060"," How do you get the word finished from terminar?","Speaker 1"
"68380","68860"," Ado.","Speaker 1"
"69040","69280"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"69680","72780"," So you have all the information, now you can build a sentence.","Speaker 1"
"73140","74480"," I have finished.","Speaker 1"
"76380","77920"," He terminado.","Speaker 2"
"78140","78460"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"78820","79940"," He terminado.","Speaker 1"
"80120","81200"," And I finished it.","Speaker 1"
"81200","83440"," I've finished it.","Speaker 1"
"84780","86460"," He lo terminado.","Speaker 2"
"87040","92800"," What is the rule about where this lo, la, me, te can go?","Speaker 1"
"93820","96320"," It's in the beginning of the sentence, actually, isn't it?","Speaker 2"
"96400","99620"," This would be a simplification of the rule that you might find unhelpful.","Speaker 1"
"100160","102760"," Well, if it was in the to form, it would be at the end.","Speaker 2"
"102940","104840"," So after the to form or?","Speaker 1"
"105240","107580"," Or before everything else.","Speaker 2"
"107620","109300"," Before the changed verb.","Speaker 1"
"109800","111360"," So this is the way you want to think about it.","Speaker 1"
"111420","118100"," If we simplify the thought to at the beginning or at the end, when there's other words there, we might be really confused about where we can put it.","Speaker 1"
"118160","123420"," So we must think after the complete verb, the to form, or before the changed verb.","Speaker 1"
"123940","129560"," So if you say he lo terminado, you've actually got it after a changed verb.","Speaker 1"
"129699","130320"," You put it after e.","Speaker 1"
"130480","134640"," So this is a very rare situation in Spanish where we have two changed verbs together.","Speaker 1"
"135340","136320"," He terminado.","Speaker 1"
"136540","139640"," We see, usually, after a changed verb, we get a complete verb.","Speaker 1"
"139900","141040"," Quiero terminar.","Speaker 1"
"141620","142940"," I want to finish.","Speaker 1"
"143460","144700"," Puedo terminar.","Speaker 1"
"145300","146920"," I can to finish.","Speaker 1"
"148400","149340"," Debo terminar.","Speaker 1"
"149880","152440"," I must, I owe to finish.","Speaker 1"
"152880","154880"," So here we have two changed verbs together.","Speaker 1"
"155160","156000"," He terminado.","Speaker 1"
"156480","159780"," Weird situation, which means there's only one place it can go.","Speaker 1"
"160240","161440"," Before the e.","Speaker 1"
"161740","162060"," Yes.","Speaker 1"
"162280","163600"," It's lo he terminado.","Speaker 2"
"163740","163960"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"164140","165440"," Lo he terminado.","Speaker 1"
"165600","166860"," And I finished them.","Speaker 1"
"168580","170040"," Los he terminado.","Speaker 2"
"171920","176360"," So with are verbs, we take off the are and we put ado.","Speaker 1"
"177180","186940"," With are ir verbs, we take away the are or the ir and we put ido to get this form of the verb that we need after haber.","Speaker 1"
"187740","189280"," Whether it's an There's no ido.","Speaker 1"
"189820","189940"," Nope.","Speaker 1"
"190300","196980"," Like I said, there's only one difference between are and ir verbs in all of the Spanish language.","Speaker 1"
"197140","199480"," Only one occasion where they're doing things differently.","Speaker 1"
"199760","201760"," And that was in the present for we.","Speaker 1"
"202520","206680"," So for example, we have vender, which means to sell.","Speaker 1"
"206860","208120"," And how do you say we sell?","Speaker 1"
"209760","210280"," Ventemos.","Speaker 1"
"210540","210800"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"211040","213100"," And we had venir, to come.","Speaker 1"
"213520","214880"," And how do you say we come?","Speaker 1"
"216240","216760"," Venimos.","Speaker 1"
"216920","217440"," Venimos.","Speaker 1"
"217440","220040"," So we had hemos and imos.","Speaker 1"
"220220","224300"," This is the only time in the whole Spanish language that these two verbs are doing something differently.","Speaker 1"
"225080","229500"," To get this form of the verb that we need after haber, everything goes to ido.","Speaker 1"
"230080","233680"," So vender becomes vendido.","Speaker 1"
"234460","237700"," And venir becomes venido.","Speaker 1"
"238000","238400"," Venido.","Speaker 1"
"238540","243620"," Now we understand where is bienvenido from welcome.","Speaker 1"
"244280","249060"," Perder, which was to lose, becomes perdido.","Speaker 1"
"249460","249800"," Perdido.","Speaker 1"
"250220","250480"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"250740","252320"," Now we can make some sentences.","Speaker 1"
"252460","254500"," How do you say I have lost?","Speaker 1"
"256260","257060"," He perdido.","Speaker 2"
"257260","258180"," He perdido.","Speaker 1"
"258680","262780"," What if you wanted to be emphatic and use the word for I to emphasize?","Speaker 1"
"264820","266120"," Yo he perdido.","Speaker 2"
"266220","266500"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"266500","267900"," Yo he perdido.","Speaker 1"
"268940","273020"," And we said that there was a connection between I and we, that we is the plural of I.","Speaker 1"
"273440","282640"," So this can help us remember that there is a little connection between he, for I have, and we have, which is?","Speaker 1"
"283120","283560"," Hemos.","Speaker 1"
"283740","284040"," Hemos.","Speaker 1"
"284180","284940"," They both use he.","Speaker 1"
"285160","285700"," He hemos.","Speaker 1"
"286020","286200"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"286460","287640"," So how do you say we have lost?","Speaker 1"
"289580","290700"," Hemos perdido.","Speaker 2"
"290840","291980"," Hemos perdido.","Speaker 1"
"293180","293740"," Nosotros.","Speaker 1"
"294480","298580"," Nosotros is the word for we, for a male or mixed group.","Speaker 1"
"298900","301480"," If you are just females, what do you think you might say?","Speaker 1"
"302820","303380"," Nosotras.","Speaker 1"
"303940","304500"," Nosotras.","Speaker 1"
"304740","305080"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"305300","307500"," You pronounced an S there, which was very good.","Speaker 1"
"307900","313980"," Most English speakers find themselves accidentally saying nosotros with a Z.","Speaker 1"
"314780","317040"," Not nosotros, but nosotros.","Speaker 1"
"317640","318100"," It's an S.","Speaker 1"
"318280","320340"," Nosotros or nosotras.","Speaker 1"
"321020","323040"," So how would you say we have lost?","Speaker 1"
"323560","324240"," Emphasizing.","Speaker 1"
"326220","326900"," Nosotras.","Speaker 2"
"327120","327460"," Sorry.","Speaker 2"
"328120","328900"," Well, it could be.","Speaker 2"
"330740","332660"," Hemos perdido.","Speaker 2"
"332860","333100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"333380","336340"," Nosotros or nosotras, if we're all females.","Speaker 1"
"336920","338280"," Hemos perdido.","Speaker 1"
"338960","339060"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"339720","346920"," So we had he and hemos, and then for the rest of the versions, we go to the other vowel, which was in this word, haber.","Speaker 1"
"347660","349940"," So give me the other versions.","Speaker 1"
"350260","354840"," Firstly, he, she, it, you formal, have, has.","Speaker 1"
"356760","357240"," Ha.","Speaker 1"
"357860","359120"," So let's start with that one.","Speaker 1"
"359160","362020"," How would you say he has lost?","Speaker 1"
"362240","363620"," Ha perdido.","Speaker 2"
"363880","363980"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"364180","368540"," And if you wanted to clarify or emphasize that it was he and not she, for example.","Speaker 1"
"371080","371400"," El.","Speaker 2"
"371900","372440"," Close.","Speaker 1"
"372660","372920"," El.","Speaker 1"
"372960","373240"," Sorry.","Speaker 2"
"373380","373580"," El.","Speaker 2"
"373700","374040"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"374460","375840"," El ha perdido.","Speaker 2"
"376000","377100"," El ha perdido.","Speaker 1"
"377280","377760"," And she?","Speaker 1"
"379480","379720"," La.","Speaker 2"
"380180","383300"," So you must differentiate between she and her.","Speaker 1"
"383680","388160"," Don't just let that feminine idea come in your mind and pick one of these.","Speaker 1"
"388300","390780"," You must take the time to decide which one is it.","Speaker 1"
"391020","392080"," Is it she or is it her?","Speaker 1"
"393280","393600"," Ella.","Speaker 2"
"393860","394240"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"394420","395380"," So she has lost.","Speaker 1"
"396460","398300"," Ella ha perdido.","Speaker 2"
"398500","398760"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"399700","401400"," You have lost informally.","Speaker 1"
"403200","404460"," Has perdido.","Speaker 2"
"404640","404880"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"405480","413720"," Now, if you want to emphasize, if you want to say you have lost, the word for you for informal is tú.","Speaker 1"
"414200","414600"," Tú.","Speaker 1"
"416100","417920"," Tú has perdido.","Speaker 1"
"418000","418220"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"418420","419560"," Tú has perdido.","Speaker 1"
"419680","420600"," What was I love you?","Speaker 1"
"421940","422620"," Te quiero.","Speaker 1"
"422840","423400"," Te quiero.","Speaker 1"
"423660","426120"," So what is the difference between tú and te?","Speaker 1"
"426840","432640"," It's the same as the difference between she and her and he and him.","Speaker 1"
"432900","439600"," Only in English, we don't have two separate words for you and you in those two different positions.","Speaker 1"
"440200","442780"," He sees, I see him.","Speaker 1"
"443220","444860"," So he sees, we use he.","Speaker 1"
"445100","446860"," Then I see him, we use him.","Speaker 1"
"447140","448900"," This is very intuitive to us in English.","Speaker 1"
"449020","450020"," We don't think about it.","Speaker 1"
"450680","452900"," She sees, I see her.","Speaker 1"
"453740","454780"," There we have the same change.","Speaker 1"
"455000","456440"," But you, it doesn't change.","Speaker 1"
"456700","458700"," You see, I see you.","Speaker 1"
"459060","462660"," So that might confuse us in Spanish because in English it doesn't change.","Speaker 1"
"462660","468640"," All we need to understand is that tú goes in the group of el, ella, yo.","Speaker 1"
"468980","469780"," Tú, you.","Speaker 1"
"470020","472200"," And te is in the group of those little words.","Speaker 1"
"472340","473700"," Lo, la, me, te.","Speaker 1"
"473960","474980"," So let's practice this.","Speaker 1"
"475720","477700"," What was to see or to view?","Speaker 1"
"479320","479640"," Ver.","Speaker 2"
"479820","480220"," Ver.","Speaker 1"
"480420","482740"," And I see is a little bit irregular.","Speaker 1"
"483280","484260"," Do you remember how it was?","Speaker 1"
"485620","485980"," Veo.","Speaker 2"
"486300","487940"," So how would you say I see it?","Speaker 1"
"488220","490660"," I see him or I see you formal?","Speaker 1"
"491960","493120"," Lo veo.","Speaker 2"
"493520","493840"," Lo veo.","Speaker 1"
"494500","494600"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"495320","503520"," I see her or I see it feminine thing or I see you speaking formally to a female?","Speaker 1"
"504980","506540"," La veo.","Speaker 2"
"506780","507360"," La veo.","Speaker 1"
"507800","516320"," Or how would you say I see them females or I see you plural or females or I see them feminine objects?","Speaker 1"
"518220","519240"," Las veo.","Speaker 2"
"519480","519740"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"519860","522720"," And what if they were masculine or mixed objects or people?","Speaker 1"
"524020","525020"," Los veo.","Speaker 2"
"525300","525560"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"526160","527180"," One set of words.","Speaker 1"
"527320","528300"," We have me for me.","Speaker 1"
"528560","530240"," We have te for you informal.","Speaker 1"
"530880","536480"," We have lo for he for masculine object, you formal.","Speaker 1"
"536860","548580"," Or even for neuter which kind of just means when something doesn't have gender maybe you'd say you know I want to see it and that it refers to a situation or something like this you will use lo.","Speaker 1"
"548760","561900"," And then from this the other ones come but building from lo so you change the o to a to make it feminine and you add your s for plural which means one sound is left in this little set which is as.","Speaker 1"
"562260","563340"," Do you remember how is as?","Speaker 1"
"564840","565140"," Nos.","Speaker 1"
"565340","565640"," Nos.","Speaker 1"
"566080","566440"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"566640","567720"," So this is one set.","Speaker 1"
"568420","570140"," Now let's practice the other set.","Speaker 1"
"570500","571840"," How do you say he sees?","Speaker 1"
"573640","574280"," Is it ve?","Speaker 2"
"574600","574980"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"575240","577700"," And what if you want to clarify or emphasize?","Speaker 1"
"579460","580720"," El ve.","Speaker 2"
"580880","581460"," El ve.","Speaker 1"
"581680","581920"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"582420","583140"," She sees?","Speaker 1"
"585140","585660"," Ella ve.","Speaker 2"
"585840","586480"," Ella ve.","Speaker 1"
"586780","587120"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"588100","588980"," I see?","Speaker 1"
"590500","591780"," Yo veo.","Speaker 2"
"591960","592320"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"592940","595820"," Now we said the word for we is nosotros.","Speaker 1"
"596500","597360"," Not us.","Speaker 1"
"597680","598300"," Us is nos.","Speaker 1"
"598980","600080"," We is nosotros.","Speaker 1"
"600860","601680"," So we see?","Speaker 1"
"603850","604710"," Nosotros vemos.","Speaker 2"
"604890","605730"," Nosotros vemos.","Speaker 1"
"606170","606510"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"607530","611030"," We said that you informal was tú.","Speaker 1"
"611690","611910"," Tú.","Speaker 1"
"612750","614590"," The you in you see.","Speaker 1"
"615190","615770"," Tú ves.","Speaker 1"
"616470","621550"," Which means that we have also the formal you to learn which is usted.","Speaker 1"
"622890","623370"," Usted.","Speaker 1"
"623370","623990"," Usted.","Speaker 1"
"624110","624570"," Usted.","Speaker 1"
"624850","625750"," Which is the formal you.","Speaker 1"
"625870","630450"," It's actually a contraction of vuestra merced which means your honour.","Speaker 1"
"630690","632930"," Something like this contracted to usted.","Speaker 1"
"633390","635330"," So this is the formal you.","Speaker 1"
"635590","638510"," So how would you say you see talking formally?","Speaker 1"
"640370","641570"," Usted ve.","Speaker 2"
"642070","642170"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"642570","644990"," You see it talking formally?","Speaker 1"
"646690","648170"," Lo ve usted.","Speaker 1"
"648830","649810"," Or usted lo ve.","Speaker 1"
"650010","650830"," It can be either way.","Speaker 1"
"651170","654090"," The word order in Spanish is much more flexible than in English.","Speaker 1"
"655130","655850"," Lo ve usted.","Speaker 1"
"656310","657010"," Usted lo ve.","Speaker 1"
"657310","657830"," Either way.","Speaker 1"
"659310","662250"," How would you say you see them still talking formally?","Speaker 1"
"664090","665990"," Usted ve los.","Speaker 2"
"666410","667330"," Sorry los ve.","Speaker 2"
"667330","667570"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"667970","669190"," Usted los ve.","Speaker 1"
"669490","669730"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"669870","670770"," So usted is flexible.","Speaker 1"
"671270","672250"," Los is not flexible.","Speaker 1"
"673050","674310"," Usted los ve.","Speaker 1"
"674610","675430"," Los ve usted.","Speaker 1"
"676110","677590"," Now the word for they.","Speaker 1"
"678250","681570"," The word for they is ellos.","Speaker 1"
"682050","685290"," E-L-L-O-S.","Speaker 1"
"685890","689970"," And this LL in most Spanish dialects makes a ll sound.","Speaker 1"
"690690","699150"," You might hear ellos around Río de la Plata in Buenos Aires of Argentina, Montevideo, Uruguay.","Speaker 1"
"699670","703310"," You might hear like a ll kind of sound in Colombia.","Speaker 1"
