"11140","11420"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"11700","32120"," We can see it ends in an A, so we would expect it to be feminine But we saw that these words ending MA in Spanish Many of them entered through Greek and in Greek they're neuter, but they look a bit masculine in Greek So they came into Spanish as masculine words, even though they end in A.","Speaker 1"
"32300","37460"," So we have el problema system Sistema.","Speaker 1"

"69460","70300"," El esquema.","Speaker 1"
"70440","79740"," We said that we cannot start S plus another consonant in Spanish We have to put an E before, like Spain, España, spaghetti, espagueti.","Speaker 1"
"79940","80560"," El esquema.","Speaker 1"
"80680","82160"," So this would be outline or diagram.","Speaker 1"

"91540","92660"," El diagramma.","Speaker 1"
"92900","93160"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"93800","103840"," So, mostly words ending O are masculine and words ending A are feminine, but we might find some exceptions Planeta, for example.","Speaker 1"
"104200","105100"," What do you think that means?","Speaker 1"
"105340","105860"," Planeta.","Speaker 1"
"106520","106920"," Planet.","Speaker 2"
"107360","109460"," Planeta is a masculine word.","Speaker 1"
"109760","112620"," So the planet El planeta.","Speaker 1"

"151760","152780"," Este auto.","Speaker 1"
"153340","154400"," Este auto.","Speaker 2"
"154720","155040"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"155600","158060"," We saw esta noche, this night.","Speaker 1"
"158700","161920"," What do you think is the difference between este and esta then?","Speaker 1"
"162100","167480"," If we have este auto and esta noche, what do you think is the difference?","Speaker 1"
"169100","172320"," Este is the masculine and esta the feminine.","Speaker 2"
"172520","172620"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"187220","188180"," Esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"188460","189140"," Esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"189760","190080"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"190080","198780"," If you take this T out of este and esta, the words for this, you get the word for that.","Speaker 1"
"199900","205500"," So este auto is this car and that car would be?","Speaker 1"
"206080","207200"," Ese auto.","Speaker 1"
"207380","208160"," Ese auto.","Speaker 1"

"213740","217220"," I don't want that car because it's very big.","Speaker 1"
"217680","219160"," Big is grand.","Speaker 1"
"219160","220900"," So how would that be in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"222380","222780"," Grande.","Speaker 1"
"222980","223280"," Grande.","Speaker 1"
"224080","227880"," I don't want that car because it's very big.","Speaker 1"

"251920","254200"," What if you wanted to say those nights?","Speaker 1"
"256560","257440"," Esas noches.","Speaker 1"
"257779","259079"," Esas noches.","Speaker 1"
"259260","259600"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"260600","264060"," There are also a few words that end in O which are feminine.","Speaker 1"
"264720","266280"," For example, mano.","Speaker 1"

"268900","270740"," It ends in O but it's a feminine word.","Speaker 1"
"271280","273460"," So how would you say the hand?","Speaker 1"
"273460","275260"," La mano.","Speaker 2"
"275400","276240"," La mano.","Speaker 1"
"276560","276740"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"294720","295000"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"295000","298240"," We have this word in English like in manuscript.","Speaker 1"
"298960","299960"," Manual as well.","Speaker 1"
"300100","300420"," Manual.","Speaker 1"
"300600","301160"," Manuscript.","Speaker 1"
"301500","303020"," That man bit there means hand.","Speaker 1"
"303960","306580"," Maintain which in Spanish is mantener.","Speaker 1"
"307460","309940"," We have main or man means hand.","Speaker 1"
"310860","311300"," Manage.","Speaker 1"
"311880","313740"," Manage means to handle.","Speaker 1"
"314160","319780"," Actually, it has a special use for handling horses historically.","Speaker 1"
"319780","326960"," Which is interesting because to manage, manejar, is used in some Latin American countries to mean to drive.","Speaker 1"
"327220","331020"," Other than to manage or to handle, it also means to drive, manejar.","Speaker 1"
"331460","337420"," Which is interesting because this verb manage historically had a special use to handle horses.","Speaker 1"
"337860","341660"," And we see how that's kind of translated over the years to driving.","Speaker 1"
"342660","346580"," How would you say, can you give me a hand?","Speaker 1"
"346580","352120"," So this is a literal translation of something idiomatic in English, but it works in Spanish as well.","Speaker 1"
"352260","353320"," In Spanish you say this.","Speaker 1"
"353900","355820"," Can you give me a hand?","Speaker 1"
"355880","356720"," And let's talk informally.","Speaker 1"
"358900","361760"," ¿Me puedes dar una mano?","Speaker 2"
"362400","363160"," But it's fair.","Speaker 1"
"363220","363820"," Una mano.","Speaker 2"
"364040","364420"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"365060","368380"," ¿Puedes darme o me puedes dar una mano?","Speaker 1"
"369180","371880"," How would you say, could you give me a hand?","Speaker 1"
"372240","374000"," Could you give me a hand?","Speaker 1"
"374000","375800"," So could is would can.","Speaker 1"
"377560","380320"," ¿Me podrías dar una mano?","Speaker 2"
"380460","380680"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"380920","382400"," ¿Me podrías dar una mano?","Speaker 1"
"382820","384600"," ¿Podrías darme una mano?","Speaker 1"
"384860","386940"," You should give me a hand.","Speaker 1"
"387240","388620"," You should give me a hand.","Speaker 1"
"388880","390340"," Should is would owe.","Speaker 1"
"390600","391200"," Still informal.","Speaker 1"
"396760","403040"," ¿Me deberías dar una mano?","Speaker 2"
"403040","404300"," Here we're not asking though.","Speaker 1"
"404380","405340"," It sounded like a question.","Speaker 1"
"405900","406920"," You should give me a hand.","Speaker 1"
"407380","408460"," Give it to me again.","Speaker 1"
"408600","409400"," Not like a question.","Speaker 1"
"409720","410960"," Like a statement.","Speaker 1"
"411100","412140"," You should give me a hand.","Speaker 1"
"413000","414500"," Deberías darme una mano.","Speaker 2"
"414640","414820"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"414880","416820"," And what if you were speaking to more than one person?","Speaker 1"
"419360","421300"," Deberían darme una mano.","Speaker 2"
"421440","421660"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"422140","423840"," Deberían darme una mano.","Speaker 1"
"424280","426160"," You guys should give us a hand.","Speaker 1"
"427960","430820"," Nos deberían dar una mano.","Speaker 2"
"430820","430920"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"431700","435480"," So we said that manejar means to handle or to manage.","Speaker 1"
"437200","437840"," Manejar.","Speaker 2"
"438400","441820"," And also to drive in some Latin American countries.","Speaker 1"
"442420","446400"," How would you say, I am managing the problem or I manage the problem?","Speaker 1"
"448480","450140"," Manejo el problema.","Speaker 2"
"450380","450620"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"451100","455940"," So how would you say, I am managing the problem and you mean right now?","Speaker 1"
"455940","463880"," So I remind you that for managing, for R verbs to get this ING, we take away R and we put ando.","Speaker 1"
"464220","470180"," And for R ear verbs, for this ING, we take away the R of the ear and we put yendo.","Speaker 1"
"470980","472980"," First part is I am managing.","Speaker 1"
"477060","478180"," Estoy manejando.","Speaker 2"
"478340","478720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"479060","480540"," I'm managing the problem.","Speaker 1"
"482120","484100"," Estoy manejando el problema.","Speaker 2"
"484100","484500"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"484660","486320"," Estoy manejando el problema.","Speaker 1"
"487120","490060"," So mano, we said, ends in O and it's feminine.","Speaker 1"
"490380","494580"," It's actually kind of the only true word that ends in O and is feminine.","Speaker 1"
"495060","498200"," So for example, we have la foto, the photo.","Speaker 1"
"498620","501420"," But foto is short for fotografía.","Speaker 1"
"502080","505180"," So it's actually la fotografía becomes la foto.","Speaker 1"
"505540","510320"," The same with la moto, the motorbike, is actually la motocicleta.","Speaker 1"
"510320","514620"," No, but people say moto and foto and it stays with la.","Speaker 1"
"515580","518159"," To take in Spanish is tomar.","Speaker 1"
"518940","519200"," Tomar.","Speaker 1"
"520280","520380"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"520620","523900"," So how would you say, I am taking a photo and you mean right now?","Speaker 1"
"526000","528600"," Estoy tomando una foto.","Speaker 2"
"528800","529100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"529420","531520"," Estoy tomando una foto.","Speaker 1"
"531840","535980"," You might hear sacar as well for photo or sacar or tomar.","Speaker 1"
"536540","537800"," Estoy tomando una foto.","Speaker 1"
"538120","539680"," Estoy sacando una foto.","Speaker 1"
"539680","541840"," Let's use tomar for now.","Speaker 1"
"542340","543880"," I would take a photo.","Speaker 1"
"545740","547100"," Tomaría una foto.","Speaker 2"
"547380","548740"," Tomaría una foto.","Speaker 1"
"549240","553860"," I would like, so it would please me to take a photo.","Speaker 1"
"554360","555980"," So this to please or like.","Speaker 1"
"557460","558080"," Gustar.","Speaker 1"
