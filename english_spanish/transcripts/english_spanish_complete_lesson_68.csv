"1540","4820"," What was tonight in Spanish, tonight?","Speaker 1"
"6660","7460"," Esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"7620","9440"," Esta noche, good, this night.","Speaker 1"
"9580","18140"," And we can use this as a hook to work out the other this's and that's and these and those that we might need.","Speaker 1"
"18660","24760"," So, esta noche, which tells us that noche is what kind of noun, what gender?","Speaker 1"
"26560","27060"," Feminine.","Speaker 2"
"27240","28300"," Feminine, good.","Speaker 1"
"28300","30280"," And what if you wanted to say that night?","Speaker 1"
"31659","34000"," What do you do to esta to get that?","Speaker 1"
"35300","35600"," Esa.","Speaker 2"
"35740","37900"," Esa, good, take away the ti, good.","Speaker 1"
"38020","38860"," So that night?","Speaker 1"
"40100","41000"," Esa noche.","Speaker 1"
"41200","41820"," Esa noche.","Speaker 1"
"42200","43260"," And those nights?","Speaker 1"
"45340","46540"," Esas noches.","Speaker 1"
"46700","48640"," Esas noches, good.","Speaker 1"
"49420","54500"," The word for man is hombre, hombre, H-O-M-B-R-E, hombre.","Speaker 1"
"55000","55520"," Hombre.","Speaker 2"
"55760","56100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"56100","58940"," How would you say this man?","Speaker 1"
"60860","62020"," Este hombre.","Speaker 2"
"62360","64420"," You think hombre is a feminine word?","Speaker 1"
"64920","65320"," Este hombre.","Speaker 2"
"66280","67980"," Este hombre, good.","Speaker 1"
"68160","68740"," That man?","Speaker 1"
"70380","71440"," Ese hombre.","Speaker 2"
"71840","72100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"72400","86900"," You can also say el hombre este, el hombre ese to say this man or that man in Spanish, which might be a structure taken from Arabic because in Arabic, you don't really have to be in the present tense.","Speaker 1"
"87580","92780"," So you can't say this man because you would understand from it that this is a man.","Speaker 1"
"92960","94920"," So in Arabic, it's the same.","Speaker 1"
"95200","97060"," El hombre este.","Speaker 1"
"97280","104020"," As I mentioned before, when languages come into contact, like the 800 years between Spanish and Arabic, they don't just share vocabulary.","Speaker 1"
"104980","106600"," How would you say these men?","Speaker 1"
"108360","109380"," Estos hombres.","Speaker 1"
"109740","110040"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"110380","111200"," Estos hombres.","Speaker 1"
"111200","122780"," So with este, we have the e of el, el hombre, este hombre, and with estos, we have the os of los, los hombres, estos hombres, these men.","Speaker 1"
"123260","124360"," How about those men?","Speaker 1"
"126830","127710"," Esos hombres.","Speaker 2"
"128009","129870"," Esos hombres, good.","Speaker 1"
"130350","138570"," So this means that we have este and esta for this when we're referring to a masculine noun or a feminine noun.","Speaker 1"
"138910","142050"," But sometimes we say this just generally, no?","Speaker 1"
"142050","143490"," Oh, I can't believe this.","Speaker 1"
"143810","147890"," We don't mean a specific noun when we say I can't believe this.","Speaker 1"
"148830","155130"," So we have like a neuter this that is not masculine or feminine, and that one is esto.","Speaker 1"
"155710","160130"," So creer is to believe, creer with two e's.","Speaker 1"
"160310","161950"," How would you say I don't believe this?","Speaker 1"
"163530","164730"," No creo esto.","Speaker 2"
"165190","165550"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"167510","167730"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"167970","169450"," I don't believe this.","Speaker 1"
"169450","173910"," How would you say I don't like anything more than this?","Speaker 1"
"174290","177950"," In Spanish you will say nothing pleases me more than this.","Speaker 1"
"178370","180230"," Nothing pleases me more than this.","Speaker 1"
"180310","182050"," I don't like anything more than this.","Speaker 1"
"183810","187690"," Nada me gusta más que esto.","Speaker 2"
"188510","188810"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"189170","191510"," Nada me gusta más que esto.","Speaker 1"
"192310","195470"," How would you say nothing pleased me more than that?","Speaker 1"
"195970","198230"," I didn't like anything more than that.","Speaker 1"
"198230","200910"," Nothing pleased me more than that.","Speaker 1"

"221870","222210"," Tan.","Speaker 1"
"222550","222890"," Tan.","Speaker 1"
"223590","224810"," In Spanish means so.","Speaker 1"
"224810","227830"," Like in the sense of so tired.","Speaker 1"
"227990","228390"," Tan.","Speaker 1"
"228510","229130"," T-A-N.","Speaker 1"
"229510","230630"," How would you say so tired?","Speaker 1"
"232610","233730"," Tan cansado.","Speaker 2"
"234150","234390"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"234470","237050"," So how would you say I was so tired?","Speaker 1"
"237490","239290"," And we mean a line in time.","Speaker 1"
"241070","242990"," Estaba tan cansado.","Speaker 2"
"243330","244370"," And you being feminine?","Speaker 1"
"244590","245150"," Cansada.","Speaker 2"
"245350","245630"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"245930","247690"," Estaba tan cansada.","Speaker 1"
"247970","252370"," What if you wanted to say we were so tired that we slept all day?","Speaker 1"
"252370","255110"," So first bit is we were so tired.","Speaker 1"
"255209","257089"," Let's be a masculine or mixed group.","Speaker 1"
"257589","258790"," We were so tired.","Speaker 1"
"260510","262770"," Estabamos tan cansados.","Speaker 2"

"264810","269210"," Estabamos tan cansados that we slept all day.","Speaker 1"
"269290","270230"," So what is this that?","Speaker 1"
"271870","272030"," Que.","Speaker 1"
"272690","276910"," Estabamos tan cansados que we slept all day.","Speaker 1"
"277090","279430"," Now all day is all the day.","Speaker 1"
"279750","280870"," You remember how is day?","Speaker 1"
"281850","282170"," Dia.","Speaker 2"

"290530","291910"," It ends in a but it's masculine.","Speaker 1"

"317570","321830"," Estabamos tan cansados que dormimos todo el dia.","Speaker 1"
"322250","324630"," So dormimos could be we slept or we sleep.","Speaker 1"
"324810","326130"," We know it's the same in the present.","Speaker 1"
"326710","334170"," But estabamos tan cansados gives us our context so we understand that of course it refers to past.","Speaker 1"
"334170","338250"," Estabamos tan cansados que dormimos todo el dia.","Speaker 1"
"338670","344550"," How would you say we were so tired when we arrived that we slept all day.","Speaker 1"

"362650","369090"," Estabamos tan cansados cuando llegamos que dormimos todo el dia.","Speaker 1"
"369690","375670"," So here in this sentence we have llegamos and dormimos that could be past or present.","Speaker 1"
"376310","376410"," No?","Speaker 1"
"376690","380950"," But estabamos brings us into the context right from the beginning.","Speaker 1"

"419070","423030"," But we know it's feminine because we said otra vez and not otro vez.","Speaker 1"
"423330","429850"," So we can if we have a word like this where it's not obvious what is the gender we need to look back to somewhere that we used it.","Speaker 1"
"430150","430670"," Otra vez.","Speaker 1"
"430850","431830"," Oh okay it's feminine.","Speaker 1"
