"1160","3820"," We said that the word for always was","Speaker 1"
"4540","5100"," siempre","Speaker 1"
"6040","11080"," Siempre good now if you know Italian or some other Latin language","Speaker 1"
"11080","15460"," Maybe you have something like sempre in that language","Speaker 1"
"15460","19480"," And you can see again that the E is splitting between sempre and siempre","Speaker 1"
"19480","26440"," So if you know one of these other language, or if you've studied them it can be useful just to notice that and just noticing that","Speaker 1"
"26440","29560"," Helps you internalize this new word so for example","Speaker 1"
"29560","36640"," Well in Spanish is bien like in the beginning of welcome bienvenido this in Italian is bene","Speaker 1"
"36640","40960"," We see that we get rid of the E last E and the E in the middle splits","Speaker 1"
"40960","43740"," You have in French bon for good.","Speaker 1"
"44120","47200"," What do you think good might be in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"47760","49640"," What do you think we'll do to make that more Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"50860","60860"," bueno We also said that vamos Vamos meant we're going on let's go and it's something that you're gonna hear all the time vamos vamos.","Speaker 1"
"61080","61440"," Let's go","Speaker 1"
"62060","62540"," now","Speaker 1"
"62540","66420"," Another useful skill that we want in language learning is to work","Speaker 1"
"66420","72140"," Backwards not just to work from the to form take off the R or the R or the E and add bits on","Speaker 1"
"72140","79000"," But we want to get in the habit of also working backwards because maybe we see or hear somewhere a word like vamos","Speaker 1"
"79000","83860"," And we want to be able to work backwards from vamos to get the other versions","Speaker 1"
"83860","88460"," Taking off the ending which is for we and putting our other bits on","Speaker 1"
"89020","90840"," So could you work out from vamos?","Speaker 1"
"91360","97000"," How it would be he goes or is going she goes or is going you from will go or are going?","Speaker 1"
"99490","106860"," The thing is you don't know the ending of the to form if you have amos You know which is your vowel no ah?","Speaker 1"
"109330","118330"," So walk backwards Ah, yes, okay So bah bah, what does that mean bah?","Speaker 1"
"120790","130610"," He she it or you formal good go Bah, how would you make that you informal?","Speaker 2"
"133140","138580"," But us good if you want to say where are you going you will hit to where are you going?","Speaker 1"
"139100","140100"," What was the word for to?","Speaker 1"
"141600","144960"," Ah, ah, so how would you say to where to where are you going?","Speaker 1"
"146880","148640"," I don't give us I don't give us.","Speaker 1"
"148980","152480"," What would be they go or you plural go?","Speaker 1"
"154120","176080"," One one one good so we can work backwards vamos bah bah bah And what was the I version it was you make you learn we remembered it by thinking I'm going on a voyage Boy boy good now the to form to go is here I Are all by itself here?","Speaker 1"
"176400","200800"," This is to go So it's it's very irregular And this is actually because this verb is two verbs that kind of stuck together to form one verb over time so in French you have like a No, which means going and in English we get alleyway from this and alleyway is like a road No, and this is related to here.","Speaker 1"
"201260","214160"," So here comes from one verb Historically and then the versions of here actually come from a different verb So they kind of stuck together over time and they give us this very irregular situation.","Speaker 1"
"214340","236100"," That's just for interest We don't need to know any of this All we need to know is boy from voyage and Bamos and we can work backwards from Bamos and there we have the complete set Boy, vamos bah bah bah, but to go is here They are coming from two different verbs historically, which is why we have here which is an ear of it But a coming up for all of the different versions.","Speaker 1"
"236540","237960"," So, how would you say I want to go?","Speaker 1"
"239640","246760"," Get a good I can go I have the power to go Where do I must go?","Speaker 1"
"248500","250100"," Devil here devil here.","Speaker 1"
"250260","251440"," I have to go.","Speaker 1"
"251660","253400"," So no, I must go there boy.","Speaker 1"
"253600","257480"," I have to go What does I have from ten air?","Speaker 1"
"259040","262120"," Tango tango, what do we add to that to get the meaning of have to?","Speaker 1"
"264240","279180"," Okay Like I said, there's no comfortable translation for it But we are don't care to tango and we get the feeling of have to rather than the feeling of possession So I have to go Tango tango, okay.","Speaker 1"
"279360","285980"," I have to go now Tango can eat our good the word for tonight is this night?","Speaker 1"
"286360","288760"," Esta noche esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"289180","291720"," So I have to go tonight.","Speaker 1"
"291820","298520"," I have to go this night Tengo que ir esta noche Now noche is feminine.","Speaker 1"
"299040","305060"," We know this because esta the word for this is ending in an a so how would you say the night?","Speaker 1"
"306060","307580"," La noche la noche","Speaker 1"
"307580","314620"," So we said the words ending a are feminine or there are feminine endings like yon or idad","Speaker 1"
"314620","317400"," La opini√≥n la oportunidad","Speaker 1"
"317400","323100"," If it ends in a knee, there's actually no way of knowing whether it's masculine or feminine","Speaker 1"
"323100","326860"," By the word you have to look at what's around it or in the dictionary","Speaker 1"
"326860","331720"," It will tell you but if you hear it in conversation, you have a look at what's around it esta noche","Speaker 1"
"331720","332440"," And then you can go.","Speaker 1"
"332700","333200"," Oh, okay.","Speaker 1"
"333280","341280"," So not just feminine another example of a feminine word that ends in a knee is carne Carne, what do you think carne means?","Speaker 1"
"341740","353480"," It's not at all obvious You have carnage in English it was just carnage carne is meat Meat and it's a feminine word.","Speaker 1"
"353620","357500"," So the meat La carne la carne.","Speaker 1"
"357620","385220"," I don't eat meat No como carne no como carne the word for end in Spanish is e and it's just spelt with a y by itself Y y I don't eat meat and I don't drink or I don't take Alcohol, so tomar was to take tomar and comer to eat So, how would you say I don't eat meat and I don't take?","Speaker 1"
"385500","406830"," Alcohol, I don't drink alcohol no, como carne and Y I don't drink alcohol No, no tomo alcohol Alcohol I'll call good cause we don't pronounce H in Spanish doing no como carne.","Speaker 1"
"407170","414690"," He not tomo alcohol or If you wanted to say I eat meat and I take alcohol I eat meat and I drink alcohol.","Speaker 1"
"414830","415770"," How would that be?","Speaker 1"
"417010","421330"," Como carne y tomo alcohol good","Speaker 2"
