"13620","13820"," Hacer.","Speaker 2"
"14100","14480"," Hacer.","Speaker 1"
"14900","15320"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"16100","18740"," Now Hacer you can use like ago.","Speaker 1"
"19180","26680"," Like in English when you say two weeks ago, you can say it makes two weeks in Spanish, and you get that meaning.","Speaker 1"
"27400","31220"," So week is semana, two is...","Speaker 1"
"31220","32520"," Do you remember two?","Speaker 1"
"33560","34000"," Dos.","Speaker 1"
"34180","34540"," Dos.","Speaker 1"
"34820","38260"," So two weeks ago, you will say it makes two weeks.","Speaker 1"
"40700","42280"," Hace dos semanas.","Speaker 2"
"42720","44020"," Hace dos semanas.","Speaker 1"

"61480","63519"," How would you say I responded?","Speaker 1"
"65620","66300"," Respondí.","Speaker 1"
"66740","67420"," Respondí.","Speaker 1"
"67660","70240"," How would you say I responded to her?","Speaker 1"
"72220","73240"," La respondí.","Speaker 2"
"73540","73680"," No.","Speaker 2"

"80960","84080"," I responded to her seven weeks ago.","Speaker 1"
"84380","88040"," Do you remember how to say seven related to September?","Speaker 1"
"89940","90440"," Siete.","Speaker 1"
"90800","91120"," Siete.","Speaker 1"
"91420","91700"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"92040","94960"," So I responded to her seven weeks ago.","Speaker 1"
"96790","101430"," Le respondí hace siete semanas.","Speaker 2"
"101910","105950"," Le respondí hace siete semanas.","Speaker 1"
"107170","112250"," Now in Spanish you can say I responded her it.","Speaker 1"
"112650","119070"," For example, I responded to her letter or I responded to her mail.","Speaker 1"
"119310","126350"," Instead of saying it this way, to her mail, in Spanish you can just say I responded him the mail.","Speaker 1"
"126670","128350"," I responded her the mail.","Speaker 1"
"128610","132130"," Or if you know what you're talking about, I responded him it.","Speaker 1"
"132310","134510"," I responded her it.","Speaker 1"
"135010","143190"," This is because, and something we will look at again later, Spanish does not use possessive words as much as English does.","Speaker 1"
"143190","146010"," So it would be much more natural in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"146270","148370"," I responded her the mail.","Speaker 1"
"149010","150910"," I responded him the mail.","Speaker 1"
"151130","153210"," Instead of I responded to her mail.","Speaker 1"
"153790","155990"," So how would you say I responded her it?","Speaker 1"
"156270","158630"," Which is in great English, and it's perfect Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"160610","162750"," Se lo respondí.","Speaker 2"
"162930","163210"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"163710","165470"," Se lo respondí.","Speaker 1"
"165770","171670"," So the se is actually le, to her, the lo is el mail, and you get se lo respondí.","Speaker 1"
"171670","173730"," I responded to her the mail.","Speaker 1"
"174130","174450"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"175310","178930"," Month is mes, mes, M-E-S.","Speaker 1"
"179330","179850"," Mes.","Speaker 1"
"180430","181590"," It's a masculine word.","Speaker 1"
"181670","183030"," So how would you say the month?","Speaker 1"
"184830","185750"," El mes.","Speaker 1"
"186030","186250"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"186310","188670"," And how would you say a month or one month?","Speaker 1"
"190270","191110"," Un mes.","Speaker 1"
"191250","191810"," Un mes.","Speaker 1"
"191890","194450"," So un mes can be a month or one month.","Speaker 1"
"194690","198970"," So how would you say I responded it to her one month ago.","Speaker 1"
"199130","201490"," I responded to her mail.","Speaker 1"

"210910","213750"," Se lo respondí hace un mes.","Speaker 1"
"213950","214370"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"215070","216690"," So we have respondí.","Speaker 1"
"217070","217930"," I responded.","Speaker 1"
"218230","222030"," How would you say he, she, it, you formal responded?","Speaker 1"

"247700","248300"," Again?","Speaker 1"
"248680","249220"," Discrimination.","Speaker 1"
"249760","251720"," In English we say discrimination or discrimination.","Speaker 1"
"251720","252120"," Discrimination.","Speaker 1"
"252360","253940"," Oh, it's with an I.","Speaker 2"
"254120","254840"," It's with an I, right?","Speaker 1"
"255899","256459"," Discriminación.","Speaker 2"
"257200","257760"," Discriminación.","Speaker 1"
"258700","259440"," To discriminate?","Speaker 1"
"261860","262420"," Discriminar.","Speaker 2"
"262720","263280"," Discriminar.","Speaker 1"
"263900","265200"," I discriminated?","Speaker 1"
"267100","267660"," Discriminé.","Speaker 1"

"338510","339030"," Salir.","Speaker 1"
"339170","339650"," Salir.","Speaker 1"
"339850","341490"," How would you say, did you go out?","Speaker 1"
"341570","342250"," Did you leave?","Speaker 1"
"344350","344870"," Saliste.","Speaker 1"

"345970","346150"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"346310","347770"," You didn't go out last night?","Speaker 1"
"348310","350090"," Last night is anoche.","Speaker 1"
"350510","351030"," Anoche.","Speaker 1"
"352190","358150"," Now if you translate to night directly, what you will come up with is anoche.","Speaker 1"
"358150","360990"," So you must be careful not to get confused here.","Speaker 1"
"361050","362790"," How do you say tonight in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"364230","364970"," Esta noche.","Speaker 1"

"365850","366490"," This night.","Speaker 1"
"366810","369730"," So anoche is last night, not tonight.","Speaker 1"

"376090","377130"," Saliste anoche.","Speaker 1"
"377290","377590"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"401350","402950"," Where were you living?","Speaker 1"
"404550","406690"," So that's the line.","Speaker 2"
"407270","408210"," Donde vivias.","Speaker 2"
"408370","408670"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"408810","409490"," Donde vivias.","Speaker 1"
"410490","414350"," So in many cases both line and point are perfectly fine.","Speaker 1"
"414770","415550"," Donde viviste.","Speaker 1"
"415970","416770"," Donde vivias.","Speaker 1"
"416770","420790"," All that means is that the speaker has two different ideas in their mind.","Speaker 1"
"421290","424790"," Maybe you go abroad to study and I will tell you donde viviste.","Speaker 1"
"425230","427470"," Or maybe I will tell you donde vivias.","Speaker 1"
"427970","428810"," Donde viviste.","Speaker 1"
"429290","430590"," Where did you live?","Speaker 1"
"430750","435050"," In this idea in my mind which is this closed amount of time.","Speaker 1"
"435570","436830"," Where were you living?","Speaker 1"
"437330","441170"," Just means the idea in my mind is an ongoing idea of time.","Speaker 1"
"441470","443770"," So many times it's completely interchangeable.","Speaker 1"
"443770","446070"," What was to wait?","Speaker 1"

"450950","455850"," So for you informal we have aste for the point in the past.","Speaker 1"

"468820","469540"," Me esperaste.","Speaker 1"
"469540","471180"," Didn't you wait for me?","Speaker 1"
"472840","474360"," No me esperaste.","Speaker 2"
"474640","476120"," Why didn't you wait for me?","Speaker 1"
"477780","479500"," Porque no me esperaste.","Speaker 2"
"479960","480260"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"480640","483080"," Porque no me esperaste.","Speaker 1"
"483660","484960"," What was to arrive?","Speaker 1"
"486560","487120"," Llegar.","Speaker 1"
"487260","487840"," Llegar.","Speaker 1"
"488140","488560"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"489240","491020"," How would you say when did you arrive?","Speaker 1"
"491400","493400"," When did you arrive informally?","Speaker 1"
"495420","496620"," ¿Cuánto llegaste?","Speaker 2"
"497120","497220"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"497360","498240"," ¿Cuándo llegaste?","Speaker 1"
"498620","500980"," This is an example of when you would need the point.","Speaker 1"
"501720","504980"," Because you probably wouldn't want to say when were you arriving.","Speaker 1"
"505660","508300"," So here it's very strongly the point in time.","Speaker 1"
"508360","509480"," When did you arrive?","Speaker 1"
"509820","510740"," ¿Cuándo llegaste?","Speaker 1"
"511299","514299"," So we have aste and iste for you informal.","Speaker 1"

"540160","541140"," Lo prepararon.","Speaker 1"
"541320","541580"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"541580","551580"," We have aron for are verbs and ieron for ere verbs.","Speaker 1"
"551880","553140"," How would you say they ate?","Speaker 1"
"554980","555640"," Comieron.","Speaker 2"

"557160","557900"," They left.","Speaker 1"
"558060","558740"," They went out.","Speaker 1"
"560500","561080"," Salieron.","Speaker 1"

"569360","569760"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"570760","581700"," So let's have a quick review of the panorama of this point in the past with hablar and comer which we might want to use as our hooks.","Speaker 1"
"582420","583640"," So we'll begin with hablar.","Speaker 1"
"583840","586000"," How do you say I spoke?","Speaker 1"
"587680","588220"," Hablé.","Speaker 2"
"588500","588960"," Hablé.","Speaker 1"
"589420","590240"," He spoke.","Speaker 1"
"591820","592660"," Habló.","Speaker 2"
"592860","593500"," Habló.","Speaker 1"

"611500","612060"," Hablaste.","Speaker 1"
"612280","612920"," Hablaron.","Speaker 1"
"613280","614640"," Now let's do the same for comer.","Speaker 1"
"614920","615980"," So for ere verbs.","Speaker 1"
"616620","618100"," How do you say I ate?","Speaker 1"
"619740","620380"," Comí.","Speaker 1"

"643800","644360"," Comieron.","Speaker 1"
"645320","653240"," So what's very interesting here is that for ere verbs in the present we had E popping up everywhere.","Speaker 1"
"653420","653540"," No?","Speaker 1"
"654260","654360"," Vive.","Speaker 1"
