"780","2040"," What was to put?","Speaker 1"
"3380","3980"," Poner.","Speaker 2"
"4840","9140"," I was putting the line in the past Ponia.","Speaker 1"
"10120","10720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"11360","27300"," Now if you want to say I put the point in the past I put in the past of course in English It's doesn't change I put present I put past I put for the past our base is pus, pus, p-u-s So how would you say I put?","Speaker 1"
"28440","29080"," Puse.","Speaker 1"
"29580","29960"," Puse.","Speaker 1"
"31040","34440"," The endings don't take the accent here for these irregular verbs.","Speaker 1"
"34660","35020"," Puse.","Speaker 1"
"35680","36980"," You put informally.","Speaker 1"
"38300","38860"," Pusiste.","Speaker 1"
"39160","40320"," Where did you put it?","Speaker 1"
"41620","42720"," Donde lo pusiste.","Speaker 1"
"42960","44380"," Donde lo pusiste.","Speaker 1"
"44740","44960"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"45820","50760"," And now we can see where that Poner pause was coming from.","Speaker 1"
"50920","56300"," We said that when we have Poner as part of a verb in Spanish It's pause in English.","Speaker 1"
"56940","57280"," Componer.","Speaker 1"
"58020","58700"," Compose.","Speaker 1"
"59080","59760"," Exponer.","Speaker 1"
"60300","60980"," Expose.","Speaker 1"
"61320","61780"," Oponer.","Speaker 1"
"62080","62720"," Oppose.","Speaker 1"
"63019","67400"," And now we hear this pause sound coming out in the dot in the past.","Speaker 1"
"67800","68080"," Puse.","Speaker 1"
"68460","69040"," Pusiste.","Speaker 1"
"69680","72300"," What was to to do or to make?","Speaker 1"
"74300","74640"," Hacer.","Speaker 2"
"75240","79200"," The base here in this point in the past is is.","Speaker 1"
"79560","85240"," H-I-C So if you want to say I made or I did.","Speaker 1"
"86800","87000"," Hice.","Speaker 1"
"87340","89500"," And he made or he did.","Speaker 1"
"91120","91440"," Hizo.","Speaker 1"
"92400","97260"," Here it would be H-I-Z or we can't keep the C because it would spell Ico.","Speaker 1"
"97660","97980"," Hizo.","Speaker 1"
"98740","100540"," They made or you guys made.","Speaker 1"
"102340","102780"," Hicieron.","Speaker 1"
"103100","103400"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"103960","114640"," Whenever you identify one of these irregular verbs in the point in the past where the base of the verb has changed Then you know what to do with it.","Speaker 1"
"115160","121480"," That E and O is coming from R And then you have Himos hicieron from ER, IR.","Speaker 1"
"122880","125000"," Sometimes the change is subtle.","Speaker 1"
"125200","127800"," We saw that Pod of Poder became Put.","Speaker 1"
"128539","133700"," We saw in another lesson that Ab of Aber became Up.","Speaker 1"
"134520","137920"," Ven of Venir becomes Vin.","Speaker 1"
"138820","140100"," So how would you say I came?","Speaker 1"
"141620","141960"," Vine.","Speaker 2"
"142260","143220"," And he came?","Speaker 1"
"144540","145000"," Vino.","Speaker 2"
"145320","146820"," You know how to say wine in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"148180","148620"," Vino.","Speaker 2"
"148880","149740"," He came with wine?","Speaker 1"
"151180","152260"," Vino con vino.","Speaker 1"
"152400","153200"," Vino con vino.","Speaker 1"
"153940","156780"," Traer to bring has Traje.","Speaker 1"
"157020","158960"," I brought in the past.","Speaker 1"
"159380","161060"," So how would you say he brought?","Speaker 1"
"162120","162840"," Trajo.","Speaker 2"
"163240","163340"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"163800","164400"," We brought?","Speaker 1"
"166600","167320"," Trajimos.","Speaker 1"
"167460","168040"," Trajimos.","Speaker 1"
"168200","169060"," And I brought again?","Speaker 1"
"170060","170420"," Traje.","Speaker 1"
"170800","175420"," And Traje also means suit like the kind you wear and it's masculine.","Speaker 1"
"175980","180440"," So I brought a suit would be Traje un Traje.","Speaker 1"
"180580","181540"," Traje un Traje.","Speaker 1"
"182060","182780"," Vino con vino.","Speaker 1"
"182980","183900"," Traje un Traje.","Speaker 1"
"184800","190180"," There's one extra irregular past point to look at.","Speaker 1"
"190560","207340"," It's extra irregular because it doesn't really follow these rules about what groups is taking the sounds from and it's also extra irregular because it is the past for both SER and IR.","Speaker 1"
"207600","212600"," It is the past for both I was and I went.","Speaker 1"
"213380","214520"," And this is FUI.","Speaker 1"
"215500","216800"," F-U-I.","Speaker 1"
"217180","217280"," FUI.","Speaker 1"
"217640","218080"," FUI.","Speaker 1"
"218720","225320"," So FUI means I was from SER point in the past and it also means I went.","Speaker 1"
"226240","231520"," So SER and IR in the point in the past they share a past.","Speaker 1"
"232000","242380"," FUI means I was or I went and FUE means he was, she was, it was, you were or went.","Speaker 1"
"242540","245040"," So we see that it's extremely irregular.","Speaker 1"
"246300","246600"," FUI.","Speaker 1"
"247040","248520"," I was or I went.","Speaker 1"
"248660","249840"," How would you say I didn't go?","Speaker 1"
"251560","251980"," No FUI.","Speaker 1"
"252180","252580"," No FUI.","Speaker 1"
"253080","253320"," FUE.","Speaker 1"
"253660","255140"," He was or he went.","Speaker 1"
"255579","256820"," How would you say he didn't go?","Speaker 1"
"258240","258700"," No FUE.","Speaker 1"
"258880","259380"," No FUE.","Speaker 1"
"259839","261540"," How would you say we went?","Speaker 1"
"262820","263380"," FUIMOS.","Speaker 2"
"263800","264140"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"264280","265040"," And you in formal?","Speaker 1"
"266560","267120"," FUISTE.","Speaker 1"
"267400","267960"," FUISTE.","Speaker 1"
"268320","279060"," Now to make they or you plural was or went we would add on IR on But we will find it very difficult to pronounce FUIERON.","Speaker 1"
"279240","279800"," FUIERON.","Speaker 1"
"280060","283000"," So the E sound, the I, fell away.","Speaker 1"
"283200","284340"," So how would that sound?","Speaker 1"
"285780","286340"," FUERON.","Speaker 1"
"286520","287080"," FUERON.","Speaker 1"
"287400","290640"," So the I, the E sound, falls away.","Speaker 1"
"291000","291520"," FUERON.","Speaker 1"
"291980","294600"," The same thing happens in a couple of other cases too.","Speaker 1"
"294760","299340"," We have TRAJERON from TRAER to bring they brought, you guys brought.","Speaker 1"
"299600","300160"," TRAJERON.","Speaker 1"
"300160","301400"," TRAJERON.","Speaker 1"
"301880","304160"," They or you guys said.","Speaker 1"
"304840","310300"," So a couple of other examples there of that I falling away just for sound reasons.","Speaker 1"
"310840","311600"," TRAJERON.","Speaker 1"
"311740","314880"," TRAJERON is kind of difficult to say.","Speaker 1"
"315100","317140"," So it fell away for efficiency.","Speaker 1"
"317540","318000"," TRAJERON.","Speaker 1"
"318320","319080"," TRAJERON.","Speaker 1"
"319240","319680"," FUERON.","Speaker 1"
"320120","325500"," So now that we have FUERON, we can make the past moot tense.","Speaker 1"
"325520","327840"," We can say something like if I were you.","Speaker 1"
"328320","332700"," Because we always go from the they form of the point in the past.","Speaker 1"
"333280","339840"," So if they went or they were is FUERON, we can say if I were you.","Speaker 1"
"340200","347340"," And of course we're using the moot tense here because we have if going into the past hypothetically.","Speaker 1"
"347680","350780"," So this is a moot tense that's quite specific for the past.","Speaker 1"
"350780","361980"," We're not putting the moot tense after see after if in the present, but for this hypothetical past if I were you, there we have it in English as well as in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"362140","367140"," We said that if I were you instead of if I was you is moot tense in English.","Speaker 1"
"367600","369880"," So how would that be if I were you?","Speaker 1"
"371800","373360"," FUERON becomes FUERA.","Speaker 2"
"373740","374060"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"374480","376680"," And the I version is FUERA.","Speaker 2"
"376800","377020"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"377660","381940"," SI FUERA TI Now it's just the word for you.","Speaker 1"
"382120","385660"," TU O USTED depending on who we're talking to.","Speaker 1"
"386000","393000"," So SI YO FUERA TU SI FUERA TU or SI YO FUERA TU, SI YO FUERA USTED if I were you.","Speaker 1"
"393320","400420"," Now we're understanding why we went from the they version to find the moot tense in the past.","Speaker 1"
"400740","411640"," Because going from the they version instead of the to form means that if there is some irregularity, we will transfer that irregularity over into the moot tense.","Speaker 1"
"412400","422220"," So we went from FUERON to FUERA and we would go from for example DIJERON they spoke to DIJERA.","Speaker 1"
"422340","425800"," So we carry over that irregularity of having lost that I.","Speaker 1"
"426220","431200"," TRAJERON they brought and then TRAJERA for the moot tense.","Speaker 1"
"431880","433700"," I had was TUVE.","Speaker 1"
"434040","436180"," What was they had or you guys had?","Speaker 1"
"438620","439260"," TUVIERON.","Speaker 1"
"439380","446400"," So now we can say if I had it, I would tell you if I had it, I would tell you.","Speaker 1"
"447860","450680"," SI LO TUVIERA, I would tell you.","Speaker 1"
"450780","452100"," You can use CONTAR.","Speaker 1"
"452500","455440"," DECIR is very irregular for WOULD.","Speaker 1"
"455940","463680"," So if you don't want to deal with that now, imagine you're in a real-life context, you can just go to the more regular verb, which is CONTAR.","Speaker 1"
"464120","465960"," I would tell you informally.","Speaker 1"
"468150","468910"," TE CONTARIA.","Speaker 2"
"469250","469510"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"470170","473870"," SI LO TUVIERA, TE CONTARIA or TE LO CONTARIA.","Speaker 1"
"474170","475050"," I would tell you it.","Speaker 1"
"475330","478770"," We like to close with this IT in Spanish a lot.","Speaker 1"
"479090","480690"," SI LO TUVIERA, TE LO CONTARIA.","Speaker 1"
"480930","481990"," I would tell you it.","Speaker 1"
"482310","482570"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"482930","492730"," So going from this they form of the point in the past, we can easily find the mood tense in the past, even if the verb is irregular.","Speaker 1"
"493590","502750"," So we have TO DO or TO MAKE, which is HACER and we said that the root for the point in the past is IS, H-I-C for the I version.","Speaker 1"
"502910","504870"," So how would you say I made or I did?","Speaker 1"
"506270","506790"," ISE.","Speaker 1"
"507190","508930"," And they did or they made?","Speaker 1"
"510370","510890"," HICIERON.","Speaker 1"
"511350","511870"," HICIERON.","Speaker 1"
"512169","512610"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"513210","517150"," So you could say I wanted for them to do it.","Speaker 1"
"517450","519870"," I wanted that they did it.","Speaker 1"
"521630","524650"," QUERÍA QUE LO HICIERAN.","Speaker 2"
"524790","525090"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"525210","527250"," I wanted them to do it.","Speaker 1"
"527310","528350"," I wanted that they do it.","Speaker 1"
"528470","529990"," QUERÍA QUE LO HICIERAN.","Speaker 1"
"530170","532350"," How would you say I wanted for us to do it?","Speaker 1"
"532710","535590"," I wanted that we do it, that we did it.","Speaker 1"
"537730","540530"," QUERÍA QUE LO HICIERAMOS.","Speaker 2"
"540570","541030"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"541130","541570"," Well done.","Speaker 1"
"541950","544590"," QUERÍA QUE LO HICIERAMOS.","Speaker 1"
"544750","545230"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"546090","553250"," I'm not as interested here in installing, let's say, all of this content, all of these irregular verbs.","Speaker 1"
"553530","563110"," What I want to give you is an exposure to how they might work, the irregular verbs that you can come across, so that practicing you can manage them.","Speaker 1"
"563570","566250"," So you should not be afraid of making mistakes.","Speaker 1"
"566350","569970"," You should build the verbs how you're used to.","Speaker 1"
"570250","576530"," And if you suspect that this one might be irregular, check, check with the person that you're speaking to.","Speaker 1"
