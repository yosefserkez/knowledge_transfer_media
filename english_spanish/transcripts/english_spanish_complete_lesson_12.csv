"780","9860"," So we we're looking at adverbs and how they work and we are changing them for the different people Let's make a recap.","Speaker 1"
"10000","12240"," How would you say to contaminate?","Speaker 1"
"13700","14180"," Contaminar.","Speaker 2"
"14360","14580"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"14720","16900"," So how would you say it's contaminating?","Speaker 1"
"18480","18960"," Contamina.","Speaker 2"
"19140","19380"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"19600","22100"," So a key vowel for adverbs is a.","Speaker 1"
"22240","23000"," That's our key vowel.","Speaker 1"
"23500","28820"," We add a N to get you guys or they contaminate.","Speaker 1"
"28900","29640"," So how would that be?","Speaker 1"
"31900","32500"," Contaminan.","Speaker 1"
"32500","33100"," Contaminan.","Speaker 1"
"33320","33560"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"34360","38800"," And we add an S to the he-she-it form to get the you informal.","Speaker 1"
"39000","44540"," So you informal contaminate would be Contaminas.","Speaker 1"
"44540","45140"," Contaminas.","Speaker 1"
"45340","45660"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"46320","51860"," Now for er-ir verbs, for er-ir verbs, their key sound is e.","Speaker 1"
"52320","56720"," For this closed group of historic verbs, their key sound is e.","Speaker 1"
"57840","60500"," So, what do you think vendor means?","Speaker 1"
"60960","61360"," Vendor.","Speaker 1"
"61440","62320"," What do you think that means?","Speaker 1"
"63560","65960"," Does it have anything to do with a vent and ventilation?","Speaker 2"
"66440","67820"," No, it's not a T, it's a D.","Speaker 1"
"68060","68480"," It's a vent.","Speaker 1"
"68680","69100"," A vending.","Speaker 1"
"69260","69840"," Vending machine?","Speaker 1"
"70340","70720"," Yeah, yeah.","Speaker 1"
"70800","71020"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"71140","72180"," So what does it mean then, vendor?","Speaker 1"
"72780","74060"," What does the vending machine do?","Speaker 1"
"75520","79380"," It's a selling machine or you might have heard street vendor as well.","Speaker 1"
"79960","82000"," So I sell or I'm selling.","Speaker 1"
"83680","84080"," Vendo.","Speaker 1"
"84080","84480"," Vendo.","Speaker 1"
"84820","85560"," I'm selling it.","Speaker 1"
"87400","88120"," Lo vendo.","Speaker 2"
"89260","89360"," Lo vendo.","Speaker 1"
"89360","89460"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"89580","90980"," Is there anywhere else you can put that lo?","Speaker 1"
"91920","92880"," Do you have the option here?","Speaker 1"
"93600","97640"," Well, we can put it at the end if it's in its vender state.","Speaker 2"
"97900","98180"," Exactly.","Speaker 1"
"98580","100160"," So now we can't put it anywhere else.","Speaker 1"
"100200","100840"," It has to go there.","Speaker 1"
"100900","101380"," Lo vendo.","Speaker 1"
"101600","102860"," How would you say I'm selling them?","Speaker 1"
"105110","105790"," Lo vendas.","Speaker 1"
"106190","108450"," It's very important when you're making...","Speaker 1"
"108450","108690"," Vendo lo.","Speaker 2"
"110170","110590"," Las...","Speaker 2"
"110590","116990"," It's very important when you're building the sentence that you take your time to understand who's doing what.","Speaker 1"
"116990","119830"," So I sell.","Speaker 1"
"119950","121090"," It's me doing the selling.","Speaker 1"
"121690","122890"," So I'm selling them.","Speaker 1"
"123110","124990"," The first bit you want to work out is I'm selling.","Speaker 1"
"125410","125890"," What's that?","Speaker 1"
"127270","127590"," Vendo.","Speaker 2"
"127830","128070"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"128169","129410"," And then you want to work out them.","Speaker 1"
"129830","131050"," I sell is vendo.","Speaker 1"
"131450","132910"," I sell them is...","Speaker 1"
"134690","135570"," Los vendo.","Speaker 1"
"135750","136370"," Los vendo.","Speaker 1"
"136530","136710"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"136790","143170"," So this process of dividing it into two thoughts, just doing that, is going to make sure that you don't kind of get this salad.","Speaker 1"
"143910","149730"," Many times you will just switch them and you want to say she has them, but you will say they have her.","Speaker 1"
"150150","152810"," You know, so it's very important to take your time to think about those bits separately.","Speaker 1"
"153730","157230"," If you're talking about feminine things like I sell the houses, how would it be?","Speaker 1"
"157590","160670"," So still them we're gonna say, but we mean feminine things.","Speaker 1"
"160790","161450"," I sell them.","Speaker 1"
"163370","164950"," Las vendo.","Speaker 1"
"165350","165910"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"166370","166970"," Las vendo.","Speaker 1"
"167310","176950"," If you want to say actually I sell or I'm selling the houses, the word for the, we said it was la, la casa, also becomes plural.","Speaker 1"
"177550","177870"," Las.","Speaker 1"
"178210","180670"," Yes, and the word casa also becomes plural.","Speaker 1"
"181390","181830"," Casas.","Speaker 1"
"182090","183470"," So I am selling the houses.","Speaker 1"
"185210","186370"," Vendo las casas.","Speaker 2"
"186490","187670"," Yeah, I'm selling the houses.","Speaker 1"
"187910","188770"," Vendo las casas.","Speaker 1"
"188910","191010"," Or I'm selling them and you mean the houses.","Speaker 1"
"192750","193790"," Las vendo.","Speaker 2"
"194150","194770"," Las vendo.","Speaker 1"
"194990","195230"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"195450","205170"," The reason why we're looking at this with objects is because many people, when they learn Spanish, they remember to change gender for people, but they kind of put all things in with lo and los.","Speaker 1"
"205550","208090"," And we kind of want to get out of that habit before it starts.","Speaker 1"
"208530","211230"," So we imagine the houses, we refer to them as las.","Speaker 1"
"211530","216650"," Is there a rule for which objects are female and which are not?","Speaker 2"
"217490","222690"," Well, remember, it's not strictly the object that has the gender, but the word, the noun in itself.","Speaker 1"
"223290","226030"," So feminine words end in a.","Speaker 1"
"226550","229270"," Words that end in a, with a few exceptions, are feminine words.","Speaker 1"
"229490","230530"," So casa is feminine.","Speaker 1"
"230810","231370"," La casa.","Speaker 1"
"231730","232350"," And it takes la.","Speaker 1"
"233050","235390"," Then there are other feminine endings.","Speaker 1"
"236030","237890"," So ion is a feminine ending.","Speaker 1"
"238670","241750"," The administration is la administración.","Speaker 1"
"242050","243470"," All of these words are going to be la.","Speaker 1"
"244110","248030"," The opinion is la opinión.","Speaker 1"
"248270","248950"," La opinión.","Speaker 1"
"249730","254530"," The association La asociación.","Speaker 1"
"254610","254890"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"255070","255769"," The celebration.","Speaker 1"
"257269","258730"," La celebración.","Speaker 2"
"258850","259870"," La celebración.","Speaker 1"
"260149","260410"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"261070","267330"," If a word ends in iti in English, it's going to be idad in Spanish most of the time.","Speaker 1"
"267910","270250"," This idad is a feminine ending as well.","Speaker 1"
"270450","273230"," So that shows us that all of these words are feminine words.","Speaker 1"
"273710","277130"," So, for example, you have diversity.","Speaker 1"
"277130","281010"," You change that iti to idad, idad.","Speaker 1"
"282130","282610"," Diversidad.","Speaker 1"
"282790","282950"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"283370","283850"," Diversidad.","Speaker 1"
"284330","285250"," The diversity.","Speaker 1"
"287390","288350"," La diversidad.","Speaker 2"
"288510","289490"," La diversidad.","Speaker 1"
"289890","290090"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"290410","291290"," The nationality.","Speaker 1"
"294610","295570"," La nacionalidad.","Speaker 2"
"295750","297170"," La nacionalidad.","Speaker 1"
"297330","301430"," The same happens with this son, that it becomes like an S or so in most of Spain.","Speaker 1"
"301850","303010"," La nacionalidad.","Speaker 1"
"303190","304610"," La nacionalidad.","Speaker 1"
"304610","305790"," You could hear it there.","Speaker 1"
"306510","307170"," The creativity.","Speaker 1"
"309390","310510"," La creatividad.","Speaker 2"
"310790","311650"," Very well pronounced.","Speaker 1"
"311910","313470"," You thought of the vowels very well.","Speaker 1"
"313690","314510"," La creatividad.","Speaker 1"
"315370","316190"," The electricity.","Speaker 1"
"318050","319730"," La electricidad.","Speaker 2"
"319890","321210"," La electricidad.","Speaker 1"
"321510","329090"," These words are very nice as well for guessing other words, because if you have this rule, electricity becomes electricidad.","Speaker 1"
"329630","333830"," You can assume that electric is probably the same in Spanish as well.","Speaker 1"
"334610","340910"," Just sounding more Spanish or having a small change, even though there's no rule for that, you can assume it.","Speaker 1"
"341310","342530"," So how do you think you would say electric?","Speaker 1"
"344250","344730"," Electric.","Speaker 1"
"344730","346110"," You sound Spanish enough yet?","Speaker 1"
"346430","346910"," Electrico.","Speaker 1"
"347230","347510"," Yeah.","Speaker 1"
"347870","348350"," Electrico.","Speaker 1"
"348610","349090"," Electrico.","Speaker 1"
"350510","351830"," How would you say generosity?","Speaker 1"
"354790","355270"," Generosidad.","Speaker 1"
"355530","355930"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"356410","356890"," Generosidad.","Speaker 1"
"357410","359030"," How do you think you would say generous?","Speaker 1"
"359730","360870"," Have a play with it.","Speaker 1"
"362030","362510"," Generoso.","Speaker 2"
"362510","364770"," Have a play with it and see what sits nice.","Speaker 1"
"366550","367030"," Generoso.","Speaker 2"
"367270","367590"," Yes.","Speaker 1"
"368210","368690"," Generoso.","Speaker 1"
"369170","369650"," Generoso.","Speaker 1"
"369970","372650"," For males, for females, what do you think it would become?","Speaker 1"
"374690","375170"," Generosa.","Speaker 2"
"375170","375650"," Generosa.","Speaker 1"
"375810","376130"," Exactly.","Speaker 1"
"376370","379290"," How lo becomes la, generoso becomes generosa.","Speaker 1"
"379750","381270"," It also can become plural as well.","Speaker 1"
"381390","385410"," If we're talking about more than one person, male or mixed group, how would it sound?","Speaker 1"
"386850","387330"," Generosos.","Speaker 1"
"387550","387790"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"387950","389750"," And if I was just speaking about females?","Speaker 1"
"391890","392290"," Generosas.","Speaker 2"
"392430","392910"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"393710","394110"," Community?","Speaker 1"
"396390","396790"," Comunidad.","Speaker 1"
"396890","397110"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"397310","397990"," The community?","Speaker 1"
"399370","400170"," La comunidad.","Speaker 1"
"400370","400970"," La comunidad.","Speaker 1"
"401250","401830"," Feminine word.","Speaker 1"
"401950","402470"," Feminine ending.","Speaker 1"
"402770","403790"," How do you think you would say common?","Speaker 1"
"404190","405810"," Common comes from community, by the way.","Speaker 1"
"407350","407990"," Is it comono?","Speaker 1"
"408650","409050"," Comono.","Speaker 1"
"409430","409830"," Común.","Speaker 1"
"410450","411850"," So there's no way to know that.","Speaker 1"
"411890","413070"," Comuno or común?","Speaker 1"
"413450","413790"," Común.","Speaker 2"
"413910","415130"," Común with the accent on the end.","Speaker 1"
"415210","416130"," So there's no way to know that.","Speaker 1"
"416250","416770"," It's regular.","Speaker 1"
"417270","418230"," There's no rule here.","Speaker 1"
"418350","419510"," So there's no irregularity.","Speaker 1"
"419510","426250"," So maybe you would say comuno and somebody would give you that feedback of común and then you would realize.","Speaker 1"
"426650","428910"," But if you didn't take that guess, you wouldn't get the word.","Speaker 1"
"429170","431570"," We will learn a lot of vocabulary very quickly this way.","Speaker 1"
"432190","433430"," How would you say opportunity?","Speaker 1"
"435430","435870"," Oportunidad.","Speaker 1"
"436650","437090"," Oportunidad.","Speaker 1"
"437590","439490"," How do you think you would say opportune?","Speaker 1"
"439570","442570"," You know, we use this word in English like timely or convenient.","Speaker 1"
"443710","444150"," Oportune.","Speaker 1"
"445910","446350"," Oportuna.","Speaker 1"
"446350","447350"," Oportuno.","Speaker 1"
"447610","450810"," Well, if you were talking about a feminine thing, oportuna.","Speaker 1"
"451770","452310"," Clarity.","Speaker 1"
"454030","454490"," Claridad.","Speaker 1"
"454670","455150"," Claridad.","Speaker 1"
"455750","457270"," And clear comes from clarity.","Speaker 1"
"457990","460910"," So you can look at claridad and you could probably guess how to say clear.","Speaker 1"
"462310","462610"," Clear.","Speaker 1"
"462950","465730"," But look at the Spanish word claridad.","Speaker 1"
"466190","466650"," Clarido.","Speaker 2"
"467610","469550"," And the idad is the ending, isn't it?","Speaker 1"
"469710","470410"," Oh, yes, claro.","Speaker 2"
"470730","471730"," Yes, claro.","Speaker 1"
"472310","474170"," So this is another good skill.","Speaker 1"
"474170","476230"," When you're guessing, you want to get rid of the ending.","Speaker 1"
"476430","478510"," This ending idad is what's making it a noun.","Speaker 1"
"478770","479730"," La claridad.","Speaker 1"
"480150","480550"," Claro.","Speaker 1"
"481010","484470"," And claro is used a lot conversationally.","Speaker 1"
"485070","489630"," Other than meaning clear as an adjective, it can also be used like of course.","Speaker 1"
"490090","491270"," Claro, claro, claro.","Speaker 1"
"491510","498030"," You will hear this a lot in conversation to show agreement or understanding of what you've said.","Speaker 1"
"498610","499110"," Claro.","Speaker 1"
"500370","500870"," Personality.","Speaker 1"
"503910","504310"," Personalidad.","Speaker 1"
"504310","504410"," Personalidad.","Speaker 1"
"504570","507770"," So we can assume that person is probably the same in Spanish as well.","Speaker 1"
"508170","509890"," When I say the same, similar.","Speaker 1"
"510450","511370"," So again, it's guessing.","Speaker 2"
"511650","511809"," It could be.","Speaker 2"
"511809","512210"," Exactly.","Speaker 1"
"512970","514049"," So what do you think it sounds like?","Speaker 1"
"514090","516270"," You will develop an intuition, especially through listening.","Speaker 1"
"516390","522830"," This is why listening is important as well, because this is what will really develop your intuition because you might have heard it before and not realise it.","Speaker 1"
"523049","525370"," I've heard of persona, so I'm guessing it's persona.","Speaker 2"
"525510","526110"," It's persona.","Speaker 1"
"526610","527210"," Oh, persona.","Speaker 2"
"527470","527850"," It's persona.","Speaker 1"
"528650","529630"," It's a feminine word.","Speaker 1"
"529630","532430"," So remember, it's the word that's feminine or masculine, not the thing.","Speaker 1"
"532750","535450"," So I am a persona, even though I'm a man.","Speaker 1"
"535610","537850"," The word is feminine, not me.","Speaker 1"
"539110","539590"," Sincerity.","Speaker 1"
"549130","551790"," So that's another example of a feminine ending.","Speaker 1"
"552130","554490"," If it ends idad, it's a feminine ending.","Speaker 1"
"554710","556670"," All of these words, without exception, are la.","Speaker 1"
"556670","559590"," If it ends ion, that's a feminine ending.","Speaker 1"
"559990","562130"," All of these words, without exception, go with la.","Speaker 1"
"562610","563230"," Back to vender.","Speaker 1"
"564010","565090"," How was I sell?","Speaker 1"
"566270","566710"," Vendo.","Speaker 2"
"566870","567810"," I want to sell.","Speaker 1"
"569610","570570"," Quiero vender.","Speaker 2"
"570890","571570"," Quiero vender.","Speaker 1"
"571810","572030"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"572090","572850"," I want to sell it.","Speaker 1"
"573830","574790"," Quiero venderlo.","Speaker 2"
"574910","575790"," Quiero venderlo.","Speaker 1"
"576310","577450"," Where else could we put that lo?","Speaker 1"
"578410","579490"," Lo quiero vender.","Speaker 2"
"579750","579970"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"580710","584710"," The er, i verbs use as their principal sound, e.","Speaker 1"
"585630","594950"," So whilst er verbs use their principal sound, a, and we got organizar, and then organisa, for, what does that mean, organisa?","Speaker 1"
"596470","601750"," He, she, or it, or you, formal.","Speaker 2"
"601950","602210"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"602630","605250"," So organisa, a, is our principal sound.","Speaker 1"
"605710","608450"," Organizan means, when we add an n, what does it mean?","Speaker 1"
"609850","610310"," They.","Speaker 1"
"610490","611030"," They organize.","Speaker 1"
"611570","611850"," Or?","Speaker 1"
"612870","614510"," You, plural.","Speaker 1"
"614510","615410"," You, plural.","Speaker 1"
"616330","620330"," So we add the n, and we get they and you guys, a, organizan.","Speaker 1"
"620570","623950"," We add the s, and we get you, informal, organizas.","Speaker 1"
"625110","629890"," So a is our key sound for er verbs, and for er, i verbs, our key sound is e.","Speaker 1"
