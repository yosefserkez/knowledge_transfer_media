"140","5680"," So, we saw that we can use the present tense to refer to the future.","Speaker 1"
"6440","12800"," For example, if we have some future context, we can just use the present tense by itself.","Speaker 1"
"13160","19960"," So, we could say, I am having breakfast with them tomorrow.","Speaker 1"
"20340","25080"," Now, in Spanish, you don't say with them, you say with they, with they.","Speaker 1"
"25340","26500"," So how would that be first?","Speaker 1"
"27620","28280"," Con ellos.","Speaker 1"
"28540","28820"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"28820","36340"," And to have breakfast, we said was to unfast, desayunar, like in English, breakfast, break, fast.","Speaker 1"
"37200","40340"," So, I'm having breakfast with them tomorrow.","Speaker 1"
"42920","45960"," Desayuno con ellos mañana.","Speaker 2"
"46280","46540"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"46760","48660"," Desayuno con ellos mañana.","Speaker 1"
"48960","49280"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"49920","60060"," And if we don't have a future context, like mañana or any other context that's showing us it's the future, we can also use, I am going to speak about the future.","Speaker 1"
"60340","63920"," So, you can say, I am going to have breakfast with them.","Speaker 1"
"64200","64760"," How is that?","Speaker 1"
"66880","72380"," Voy a desayunar con ellos, con ellos.","Speaker 2"
"72560","72800"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"73340","74880"," Voy a desayunar con ellos.","Speaker 1"
"75240","75460"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"75820","80520"," And if we had the future context, it doesn't mean we have to say, desayuno con ellos mañana.","Speaker 1"
"80740","83760"," We could also say, voy a desayunar con ellos mañana.","Speaker 1"
"83760","87480"," The fact that we have future context doesn't mean we can't use voy anymore.","Speaker 1"
"88060","96060"," So, we've seen in that way we can use the present to talk about the future, but this doesn't mean that we don't have a future tense in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"96180","96500"," We do.","Speaker 1"
"97060","103100"," Luckily, we don't have to learn any new sounds to master the future tense in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"103680","109600"," The future tense in Spanish is connected with the past tense that we learn of haber.","Speaker 1"
"110360","110880"," Haber.","Speaker 1"
"110880","111060"," Haber.","Speaker 1"
"111060","118100"," This past of I have had breakfast, or I have eaten, I have gone.","Speaker 1"
"118380","120940"," So, let's make a recap of the forms of haber.","Speaker 1"
"121640","132580"," Now, it's very irregular, haber, and we said that a nice trick to remember the different forms of haber is just looking at the two vowel sounds inside the verb haber.","Speaker 1"
"133000","134600"," So, what are those two vowel sounds?","Speaker 1"
"135500","136940"," A and E.","Speaker 1"
"137200","137600"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"137780","138700"," Let's start with E.","Speaker 1"
"138700","140620"," What does E mean by itself?","Speaker 1"
"142000","142540"," I have.","Speaker 2"
"142860","143220"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"143720","145220"," I have, spelled H-E.","Speaker 1"
"145940","147940"," And what other person is connected with I?","Speaker 1"
"148160","149980"," What's the plural of I, let's say?","Speaker 1"
"151360","151760"," Emos.","Speaker 2"
"152040","152320"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"152600","152780"," We.","Speaker 1"
"153120","155700"," So, we have E for I have and Emos for we have.","Speaker 1"
"156120","158220"," What is A by itself, H-A?","Speaker 1"
"160280","164880"," He, she, it, or you, formal.","Speaker 2"
"165100","165400"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"165740","168140"," So, give me the other two versions now.","Speaker 1"
"169580","169720"," An.","Speaker 2"
"170180","170520"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"170980","171780"," They or you guys.","Speaker 1"
"171920","172220"," Or you.","Speaker 2"
"172680","172860"," Yeah.","Speaker 2"
"173460","176680"," And as, which is you, informal.","Speaker 2"
"176900","177220"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"177580","178540"," So, that's all said.","Speaker 2"
"179000","183480"," Let's practice a little bit, some structures with haber, just to recap.","Speaker 1"
"184300","189220"," So, what was to sleep, dormant?","Speaker 1"
"189780","190240"," Dormir.","Speaker 1"
"190440","190680"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"190860","192240"," So, how would you say I have slept?","Speaker 1"
"192540","193600"," Begin with I have.","Speaker 1"
"195580","196580"," He, dormido.","Speaker 2"
"197080","197800"," We have slept?","Speaker 1"
"200140","201140"," Hemos dormido.","Speaker 2"
"201300","202080"," He has slept?","Speaker 1"
"203820","204820"," Ha dormido.","Speaker 2"
"205000","205260"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"205580","207140"," How would you say to recommend?","Speaker 1"
"210180","211180"," Recomendacion, recomendar.","Speaker 2"
"211480","214900"," So, how would you say they have recommended it?","Speaker 1"
"215140","216680"," They have recommended it.","Speaker 1"
"216860","221100"," And I remind you that with the structures with haber, the it has to come before haber.","Speaker 1"
"221400","223120"," There's no option of where to put it.","Speaker 1"
"223120","225220"," So they have recommended it","Speaker 1"
"226440","227860"," Lo han","Speaker 2"
"228820","231560"," Recomendado lo han recomendado good","Speaker 1"
"231560","238360"," So these forms that we have these forms of a bear that we have a mos","Speaker 1"
"238360","244460"," Ah us and are also the endings that we have for the future tense","Speaker 1"
"244460","250360"," So like I said, we will learn the future tense now without having to learn any new sounds now","Speaker 1"
"250360","257899"," The interesting thing about the future tense is that we take the verb in its to form where it's an hour verb air verb or?","Speaker 1"
"258060","265140"," Ear verb doesn't matter and we put the ending at the end of the to form and we stress the ending we are","Speaker 1"
"265140","265840"," effectively","Speaker 1"
"266360","271340"," Pushing the accent into the future for example","Speaker 1"
"271340","278680"," We have comer and what was I have from a bear a a so that's the sound without the H","Speaker 1"
"278680","283540"," Just the sound a that's the sound that we need for future for I","Speaker 1"
"283540","290240"," We add that on to comer and we get comere and that's I will eat","Speaker 1"
"290940","295900"," Now we are pushing the accent into the future which might just seem like a coincidence","Speaker 1"
"295900","301780"," But you can notice that it happens in other languages as well this phenomenon for example in Greek","Speaker 1"
"301780","309220"," Part of the past tense is to pull the accent back one syllable to pull the accent back into the past","Speaker 1"
"309220","314000"," And actually this is so important in Greek that if there is not a syllable there to do it","Speaker 1"
"314000","317700"," You add one to pull the accent back into the past","Speaker 1"
"317700","322880"," So this is a phenomenon that you see in in different languages the accents","Speaker 1"
"323700","329140"," Representing somehow or reflecting somehow the concept of of time and tenses","Speaker 1"
"329140","333060"," So here we are pushing the accent into the future comere.","Speaker 1"
"333380","353720"," I will eat You can give me the rest of the versions for the future of comer Comeremos good comeremos we will eat Comera good he will eat Comeras you informal will eat Comeran good they or you guys will eat good.","Speaker 1"
"353840","355300"," What was to go?","Speaker 1"
"355300","376000"," We said it was very irregular we have boy and Bamos and bar, but the verb to go doesn't look anything like them here here Here in the future is regular so we can follow these rules and get the the future Tenses of to go I will go he will go so what is I will go?","Speaker 1"
"378180","406800"," Yeah, yeah, and we will go He demos he demos he will go He eat up eat up they or you guys Iran Iran like the country they will go to Iran Iran Iran Iran Iran good you informal will go Yes, good, and what if we wanted to make it a question will you go?","Speaker 1"
"408420","410760"," Yes, good won't you go?","Speaker 1"
"411840","412440"," No, it us.","Speaker 2"
"412680","413460"," Why won't you go?","Speaker 1"
"414260","418880"," But Canada's good, what was to find or to encounter?","Speaker 1"
"420360","427300"," Encounter and contrar I will find Encounter a good and contrary.","Speaker 1"
"427620","432200"," I will find it No and contrary good.","Speaker 2"
"432260","447820"," No and contrary We will find it Lost and contrary that was an interesting era because I said we so I made I Plural with we and your mind made the it plural, huh?","Speaker 1"
"448880","450640"," Yeah, we will find it","Speaker 1"
"451880","452560"," No","Speaker 2"
"453240","459540"," Encounter a most good law and contra demos he or she or you formal will find it","Speaker 1"
"460910","462030"," No","Speaker 2"
"462770","471010"," Contrary good law and contrary he will find them or she will find them or you formal will find them","Speaker 1"
"471930","473330"," lost and","Speaker 1"
"473330","479110"," Contrary so you made both of them them or they you said them","Speaker 1"
"479110","483950"," But we said he will find them or she will find them loss","Speaker 1"
"484990","490250"," Contrary good loss and contrary so I want to think about the two things separately","Speaker 1"
"490250","495330"," The who is doing the verb and who are they doing it to who or what are they doing it to?","Speaker 1"
"495910","506510"," We said that quedar means to remain Quedar and to get the meaning of I stay we say I remain myself How was that I remain myself?","Speaker 1"
"508350","509610"," Make it make it.","Speaker 1"
"509710","510450"," Oh good.","Speaker 1"
"511270","511929"," How would you say?","Speaker 1"
"512110","526230"," I will stay then I will remain myself Good but yeah that a means I will remain and if you want the meaning of stay you must must use Yeah, make it a make it a day.","Speaker 1"
"526350","532770"," I will remain myself, or I will stay I will stay here Make it a key good.","Speaker 1"
"532890","534090"," What was to prepare?","Speaker 1"
"535230","537710"," Prepare good, and I will prepare","Speaker 1"
"539750","543650"," Preparatory good, so it's very important to think out the whole verb","Speaker 1"
"544430","545850"," Preparatory and then I don't the a","Speaker 1"
"546650","551330"," Preparatory because a very common mistake that the learners make is to say","Speaker 1"
"551330","555690"," Preparatory and they miss out the last hour because they don't think out the whole verb first","Speaker 1"
"555690","561690"," So we must think out the whole verb first preparatory and then I don't the ending preparatory.","Speaker 1"
"561850","563410"," What was to wait or to hope?","Speaker 1"
"565810","600980"," Esperar I will wait Good what was to organize Organizar good he will organize Organizar a good Organizar a so the useful thing about the accent being on descending is that we don't have to worry about where the accent goes when we're pronouncing the whole verb Organizar a on the end Organizar a they will organize Organizar a good Organizar a good.","Speaker 1"
"601100","602500"," What was tired?","Speaker 1"
"603800","606540"," Can't sound good can sado.","Speaker 1"
"606920","608120"," So how would you say?","Speaker 1"
"608300","609780"," I will be tired.","Speaker 1"
"609860","623720"," I will be tired City Estar a can sada good a star a can sada good How would it will be be from sir?","Speaker 1"
"624200","630180"," It will be using sir Sarah good some familiar from anywhere.","Speaker 1"
"630400","630800"," Yes, sir.","Speaker 2"
"630820","631360"," Yes","Speaker 2"
"633740","638480"," So very simple the future tense doesn't matter if we have our air or ear verb","Speaker 1"
"638480","644360"," We are adding on these endings and these endings are the same as the different versions of a bear","Speaker 1"
"644360","648720"," So if you forget them, we can look back to a bear and then we just had that on the end","Speaker 1"
"648720","653800"," But in saying that the future tense is not so often used in Spanish","Speaker 1"
"653800","657800"," Most of the time you will find yourself using present or boy","Speaker 1"
"657800","662120"," Vamos up, but the future tense does exist and now you know it","Speaker 1"
