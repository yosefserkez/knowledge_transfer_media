"970","18230"," These go verbs, these verbs that take go instead of o for the i version in the present, also behave a little bit strangely in the future tenses, in the will and would tenses.","Speaker 1"
"18950","27810"," So we can look at that now and whilst looking at it revise the endings that we learned for will and would.","Speaker 1"
"28370","40070"," So we said that our will endings, what we add on to the two form of the verb to get will, are the same as those very irregular versions of are there in the present.","Speaker 1"
"40290","44410"," So we can make that connection to help us internalize them.","Speaker 1"
"44570","47150"," Can you talk me through those will endings?","Speaker 1"
"48270","53630"," So it's e for I and emos for us.","Speaker 2"
"54410","55250"," For we, very good.","Speaker 1"
"56150","61190"," A for he, she, it and you formal.","Speaker 2"
"62010","63310"," An for they.","Speaker 2"
"63989","66570"," They or you plural and the last one you informal.","Speaker 1"
"66930","67230"," As.","Speaker 1"
"67410","67690"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"67830","76630"," So we have the endings and our endings for would, which again we are adding on to the two form of the verb.","Speaker 1"
"77290","80590"," We need to remember one key sound for would.","Speaker 1"
"81110","86070"," If we remember how to say I would like, that's a nice hook to remember the key sound.","Speaker 1"
"86190","87150"," So what is the key sound?","Speaker 1"
"89130","89430"," Ia.","Speaker 2"
"89650","90130"," Ia.","Speaker 1"
"90510","95750"," And then on to Ia we can add on of course our mos or n or s if we need to.","Speaker 1"
"96190","96350"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"97150","112390"," So go verbs, these verbs that have go and then ga for the mood tense, when they are building the futures they have a contraction but they all make the same contraction.","Speaker 1"
"113250","116570"," For example I will have is tendre.","Speaker 1"
"117230","117990"," Tendre.","Speaker 1"
"118510","119270"," Tendre.","Speaker 2"
"119550","119930"," Tendre.","Speaker 1"
"120210","122450"," So of course it should be tenere.","Speaker 1"
"122450","122710"," No?","Speaker 1"
"123950","125050"," But it's tendre.","Speaker 1"
"125490","130110"," So that last e of tenere turns into a d and we get tendre.","Speaker 1"
"130490","135010"," This is a contraction because it means we end up with two syllables instead of three.","Speaker 1"
"135290","140710"," It would be tenere but it's tendre, which just makes everything a little bit more efficient.","Speaker 1"
"141370","145670"," But all of these verbs, these go verbs, are behaving in a similar way.","Speaker 1"
"146210","148670"," So we have to come.","Speaker 1"
"150710","152590"," And I will come.","Speaker 1"
"154990","156050"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"156370","157250"," I would come.","Speaker 1"
"157930","160330"," The same contraction for both futures.","Speaker 1"
"163930","164630"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"164930","165830"," I would come.","Speaker 1"
"166110","166790"," We would come.","Speaker 1"
"166790","176410"," We would come later but we don't have time.","Speaker 1"
"183070","183810"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"185750","189790"," What was to put?","Speaker 1"
"191430","192850"," And I put?","Speaker 1"
"194410","194970"," Pongo.","Speaker 2"
"195270","195810"," Pongo.","Speaker 1"
"196290","203750"," So this go alerts us to the fact that this verb will behave in this irregular way as well.","Speaker 1"
"203870","207410"," So if you want to say I will put it here, how would it be?","Speaker 1"
"207650","208850"," I will put it here.","Speaker 1"
"212220","212780"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"212980","215980"," I would put it here.","Speaker 1"
"216180","217140"," I would put it here.","Speaker 1"
"220060","220620"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"220880","222020"," We would put it here.","Speaker 2"
"224960","225680"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"227260","229960"," And we will put it here.","Speaker 1"
"232960","233680"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"235740","237520"," What was to leave or to go out?","Speaker 1"
"239880","242160"," I leave or I go out?","Speaker 1"
"245240","254040"," So again this go can set off a little alarm bell that this verb will probably be irregular in the futures.","Speaker 1"
"254500","257260"," So how would you say I would leave or I would go out?","Speaker 1"
"260680","261200"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"261880","264800"," You would leave or you would go out informally?","Speaker 1"
"269040","270500"," Will you leave?","Speaker 1"
"270700","272080"," Will you go out tonight?","Speaker 1"
"272700","273940"," Will you go out tonight?","Speaker 1"
"277660","278700"," That's would you.","Speaker 1"
"279060","280160"," Now we want will you.","Speaker 1"
"283040","283620"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"285400","289260"," But of course we have esta noche which is future context.","Speaker 1"
"289700","290900"," So we could just use the present.","Speaker 1"
"291700","293580"," We could just say you go out tonight.","Speaker 1"
"294040","295100"," We don't need the future.","Speaker 1"
"295260","296080"," So how would that be?","Speaker 1"
"300120","300700"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"301200","309900"," So for most go verbs we take off the go and we put dre for I will and drea for I would.","Speaker 1"
"309900","311120"," With most of them.","Speaker 1"
"311600","313580"," Traer, to bring, doesn't do it.","Speaker 1"
"314060","315920"," Traere, I will bring.","Speaker 1"
"316480","318560"," Atraere, I will attract.","Speaker 1"
"319340","321640"," Distraere, I will distract.","Speaker 1"
"322280","327200"," But most of these that have go will go to drea or dre.","Speaker 1"
"328600","332720"," Hacer and decir, to do or to make or to say or to tell.","Speaker 1"
"333180","338980"," Hacer and decir are particularly irregular and we've already seen this.","Speaker 1"
"339320","343320"," We've seen how after haber they become hecho and dicho.","Speaker 1"
"343820","344820"," It's very irregular.","Speaker 1"
"345360","351360"," We saw how the informal command from hacer is as, H-A-Z, again irregular.","Speaker 1"
"351620","352540"," And here as well.","Speaker 1"
"353060","355020"," I will do is are.","Speaker 1"
"355280","356940"," So it's not following this rule.","Speaker 1"
"357080","358100"," It's even more irregular.","Speaker 1"
"358280","361780"," We have are, I will do, I will make.","Speaker 1"
"362440","364980"," H-A-R-E, are.","Speaker 1"
"365460","375500"," And all we need to do is identify one of these irregularities and then we understand that all of will and all of would we use the same base.","Speaker 1"
"375820","378220"," The same base that are has used.","Speaker 1"
"379020","382060"," So we will do or we will make is?","Speaker 1"
"383420","384020"," Aremos.","Speaker 1"
"384160","384440"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"384560","386500"," And we would do or we would make?","Speaker 1"
"388060","388700"," Haríamos.","Speaker 1"
"389040","389680"," Haríamos.","Speaker 1"
"390160","392420"," We would do it but we're busy now.","Speaker 1"
"392600","394780"," We would do it but we're busy now.","Speaker 1"
"396880","399660"," Lo haríamos pero estamos.","Speaker 2"
"401280","401920"," Occupied.","Speaker 1"
"402600","404020"," Ocupados ahora.","Speaker 2"
"404360","404720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"405180","409000"," Lo haríamos pero estamos ocupados ahora.","Speaker 1"
"409240","411340"," We would do it but we're busy now.","Speaker 1"
"411660","414820"," So haríamos is we would do or we would make.","Speaker 1"
"414920","417120"," And what is we will do or we will make?","Speaker 1"
"419240","419740"," Aremos.","Speaker 1"
"419920","420560"," Aremos.","Speaker 1"
"420880","423340"," And they will do, they will make?","Speaker 1"
"425320","425760"," Harán.","Speaker 2"
"425940","426420"," Harán.","Speaker 1"
"427240","430960"," I would say or I would tell is diría.","Speaker 1"
"431460","434620"," So we get from decir diría.","Speaker 1"
"434940","438960"," I would say, he would say, she would say, informal would say.","Speaker 1"
"439160","439600"," Diría.","Speaker 1"
"440360","446200"," So like I said we just need one of these versions to understand how the rest will be.","Speaker 1"
"446520","452360"," So if diría is I would say or I would tell, how is I will say or I will tell?","Speaker 1"
"453940","454460"," Diré.","Speaker 2"
"454620","455020"," Diré.","Speaker 1"
"455220","457540"," I will tell you later speaking informally.","Speaker 1"
"459420","460800"," Te diré más tarde.","Speaker 2"
"461000","461300"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"461480","462840"," Te diré más tarde.","Speaker 1"
"463220","468240"," And of course having future context with más tarde we could just say.","Speaker 1"
"469660","471280"," Te digo más tarde.","Speaker 2"
"471720","472060"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"472300","473420"," Te digo más tarde.","Speaker 1"
"473980","475520"," I tell you later.","Speaker 1"
"476220","477640"," What was to be able to?","Speaker 1"
"479200","479800"," Poder.","Speaker 2"
"480040","480560"," Poder.","Speaker 1"
"480920","484500"," How do you say I would be able to or I could?","Speaker 1"
"486160","486420"," Podría.","Speaker 1"
"486700","487280"," Podría.","Speaker 1"
"487620","487860"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"487940","489000"," The F falls out.","Speaker 1"
"489180","490920"," So this is a different irregularity.","Speaker 1"
"491040","492220"," This is not a go verb.","Speaker 1"
"492780","493460"," Podría.","Speaker 1"
"493780","500400"," Of course it was podería but many years of podería, podería, podería, podería, the F fell away.","Speaker 1"
"500820","501180"," Podría.","Speaker 1"
"501720","503220"," How is to put?","Speaker 1"
"504820","505500"," Poner.","Speaker 1"
"505720","506200"," Poner.","Speaker 1"
"506540","507820"," And I would put?","Speaker 1"
"509300","509980"," Pondría.","Speaker 2"
"510180","510820"," Pondría.","Speaker 1"
"511419","511720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"511799","519280"," So there's a subtle difference in sound between I would be able to, podría and I would put.","Speaker 1"
"520100","520440"," Pondría.","Speaker 1"
"521059","522520"," We would be able to?","Speaker 1"
"524020","524640"," Pondríamos.","Speaker 1"
"525340","526960"," We would be able to.","Speaker 1"
"527120","528320"," That's we would put.","Speaker 1"
"529380","530060"," Pondríamos.","Speaker 2"
"530340","530900"," Pondríamos.","Speaker 1"
"531320","533660"," And we would put?","Speaker 1"
"535600","536440"," Pondríamos.","Speaker 1"
"536720","537440"," Pondríamos.","Speaker 1"
