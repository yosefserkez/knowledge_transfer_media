"1160","7580"," To know, in Spanish, is saber, saber, saber, saber.","Speaker 1"
"7740","11940"," You may have heard in British slang, he's got savvy, she's got savvy.","Speaker 1"
"12140","12920"," Have you ever heard that?","Speaker 1"
"13080","13200"," Yeah.","Speaker 1"
"13700","15680"," And that comes from Latin, actually.","Speaker 1"
"15840","17260"," That slang is coming from Latin.","Speaker 1"
"17460","21300"," Saber is to know, he's got saber, he's got savvy.","Speaker 1"
"21900","26060"," Saber is spelt with a B, but in English we are saying savvy with a V.","Speaker 1"
"26320","34020"," So we're seeing even that connection between the sounds of V and B, crossing between English and Spanish, saber, savvy.","Speaker 1"
"34440","35520"," So saber is to know.","Speaker 1"
"36080","37460"," So if you want to say, I want to know.","Speaker 1"
"40560","42700"," How would you say, I don't want to know?","Speaker 1"
"45080","45320"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"45420","50120"," How would you say, he wants to know, or she wants to know, or you woman want to know?","Speaker 1"
"53080","53420"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"53560","56040"," We change the O to E, and you get quiere.","Speaker 1"
"56340","58480"," Quiere saber, he doesn't want to know.","Speaker 1"
"60540","62320"," Why doesn't he want to know?","Speaker 1"
"64519","66490"," I want to know why he doesn't want to know.","Speaker 1"
"71200","71780"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"74520","75600"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"76300","80380"," The word for yes in Spanish is si.","Speaker 1"
"81800","84200"," This is also the word for if.","Speaker 1"
"85060","85920"," So how do you say if?","Speaker 1"
"86340","86580"," Si.","Speaker 1"
"86840","87100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"87100","90800"," I want to know if you want to know.","Speaker 1"
"90920","92080"," Of course, we're speaking formally.","Speaker 1"
"92280","93460"," This is the one we learned so far.","Speaker 1"
"93900","96240"," I want to know if you want to know.","Speaker 1"
"100400","100740"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"103260","107260"," I want to know if he wants to invite me.","Speaker 1"
"108060","110000"," So the first bit is I want to know.","Speaker 1"
"114160","116280"," B sound, because it's a B here.","Speaker 1"
"119820","122240"," If he wants to invite me.","Speaker 1"
"126280","129979"," So you see, if you think about it block by block, it's very simple.","Speaker 1"
"130200","134620"," If we think slowly, we learn very quickly, and the process gets much faster.","Speaker 1"
"135380","136200"," How do you say imagination?","Speaker 1"
"139640","140080"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"140500","141800"," I don't want to imagine.","Speaker 1"
"142120","143280"," I don't want to imagine it.","Speaker 1"
"145020","145620"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"147660","149020"," What was to come?","Speaker 1"
"149260","154580"," And we said that we can remember if we look at convenient, conveniente, which is like with coming.","Speaker 1"
"155420","156020"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"157740","165140"," I want to know if she wants to come to the house to visit me.","Speaker 1"
"165560","169380"," I want to know if she wants to come to the house to visit me.","Speaker 1"
"169380","176560"," So again, it might be something that looks overwhelming that we can't say, but if we divide it up, I want to know.","Speaker 1"
"181800","184260"," If she wants to come.","Speaker 1"
"187380","187600"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"188080","188840"," To the house.","Speaker 1"
"191840","192140"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"192420","193180"," To visit me.","Speaker 1"
"197220","197680"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"197680","211120"," You put a there, because even though we have a la casa there in between, you stayed with the feeling of venir, and you wanted to connect it to the next verb, and you are 100% correct to do that.","Speaker 1"
"211640","216360"," I want to know why she doesn't want to come to the house to visit me.","Speaker 1"
"217400","223800"," I want to know why she doesn't want to come to the house to visit me.","Speaker 1"
"224480","225840"," I want to know.","Speaker 1"
"228160","229000"," Saber.","Speaker 1"
"230120","230540"," Why.","Speaker 1"
"233120","234280"," She doesn't want.","Speaker 1"
"236580","238280"," To come to the house.","Speaker 1"
"241500","242640"," To visit me.","Speaker 1"
"244620","244720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"245340","245840"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"246300","246760"," Well done.","Speaker 1"
"252340","254020"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"254580","276140"," So, what we must want to take away from this, is the confidence to try to say what we are almost sure we cannot say, because we have this wonderful advantage as English speakers, that we have so much vocabulary that we can convert over to Spanish, that we won't realise we can convert over to Spanish until we try it.","Speaker 1"
"277200","281740"," I will just give you now a couple of sentences for listening practice.","Speaker 1"
"281740","284040"," What does it mean if I say...","Speaker 1"
"291420","292900"," What did I say?","Speaker 1"
"293500","294160"," First bit is...","Speaker 1"
"297260","299060"," I'm going to invite them.","Speaker 2"
"299600","300360"," Oh, you.","Speaker 1"
"301060","302660"," It could be you, you formal.","Speaker 1"
"302740","303940"," You formal or him.","Speaker 2"
"304200","304300"," Yeah.","Speaker 1"
"306140","309780"," If it can make some sense, I'm going to invite it.","Speaker 1"
"311740","312260"," Pero.","Speaker 1"
"313520","314780"," What is pero?","Speaker 1"
"315260","315560"," But.","Speaker 2"
"315820","316080"," But.","Speaker 1"
"320200","323900"," But I won't invite him now.","Speaker 2"
"324220","324760"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"330460","332800"," I want to start now.","Speaker 2"
"333000","333280"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"333840","335200"," And something missing though.","Speaker 1"
"337300","339460"," I want to start it now.","Speaker 1"
"339540","339740"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"345900","347560"," You want or he wants?","Speaker 1"
"347880","348020"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"348360","349580"," Or she wants.","Speaker 1"
"349880","350000"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"358420","360720"," Why doesn't he want to let me know?","Speaker 2"
"361140","361900"," To inform me?","Speaker 2"
"361960","362620"," Yeah, perfect.","Speaker 1"
"362780","363980"," But this is perfect what you did.","Speaker 1"
"364080","364660"," You found...","Speaker 1"
"364660","367380"," You got the meaning and you said how it's comfortable for you in English.","Speaker 1"
"367500","367840"," Exactly.","Speaker 1"
"368020","369180"," Why doesn't he want to inform me?","Speaker 1"
"369240","370520"," Why doesn't he want to let me know?","Speaker 1"
"370680","371020"," Perfect.","Speaker 1"
"371740","374460"," How is a justification in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"376040","377720"," Is it a sound?","Speaker 1"
"377980","378140"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"378540","379160"," Yes.","Speaker 1"
"379600","380260"," If it's...","Speaker 1"
"384000","385080"," To justify.","Speaker 1"
"388360","391260"," I'm not trying to justify myself.","Speaker 1"
"391680","394520"," I'm not trying to justify myself.","Speaker 1"
"394800","396180"," What is myself in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"397140","398680"," Yes, same as me.","Speaker 1"
"399340","399880"," Same as me.","Speaker 1"
"400040","400280"," Stop.","Speaker 1"
"400420","401200"," I'm not trying.","Speaker 1"
"402720","406040"," No intento justificarlo.","Speaker 2"
"406520","408500"," No, justificarme.","Speaker 2"
"409260","412200"," No intento justificarme.","Speaker 1"
"412860","415160"," But I want to explain.","Speaker 1"
"415560","417520"," Now, explain is an exception.","Speaker 1"
"418560","424220"," We have explanation in English, but this in Spanish is explicaci贸n.","Speaker 1"
"424840","427080"," It changes, so it's an exception.","Speaker 1"
"427500","429940"," We don't say explanaci贸n, but explicaci贸n.","Speaker 1"
"429940","431860"," We have this in English as well.","Speaker 1"
"431940","433700"," We have an English inexplicable.","Speaker 1"
"434220","435320"," How do you say that in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"437440","437900"," Yes.","Speaker 1"
"438400","442100"," We have even in English this root of the C sound with explain.","Speaker 1"
"442240","444500"," We say explain, but then we say inexplicable.","Speaker 1"
"445080","448220"," So, explanation is explicaci贸n in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"448760","449760"," So, how is to explain?","Speaker 1"
"452840","455240"," So, but I want to explain.","Speaker 1"
"458800","459100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"459100","460840"," Do you remember how to say something?","Speaker 1"
"462760","463640"," Well done.","Speaker 1"
"464020","466440"," But I want to explain you something.","Speaker 1"
"466680","467740"," In English, maybe it's more common.","Speaker 1"
"467900","470320"," We would say I want to explain something to you.","Speaker 1"
"470560","474580"," But in Spanish, we can just say, but I want to explain you something.","Speaker 1"
"474720","476540"," And let's say informally.","Speaker 1"
"476880","478900"," So, what was the word for you for informal?","Speaker 1"
"479780","481480"," We can remember it from I love you.","Speaker 1"
"481580","482900"," Yes, te quiero.","Speaker 1"
"483620","486460"," So, but I want to explain you something.","Speaker 1"
"490500","491340"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"493580","494660"," Let's say it all together.","Speaker 1"
"495260","500660"," I'm not trying to justify myself, but I want to explain something to you.","Speaker 1"
"502020","504100"," So, I'm not trying is the first bit.","Speaker 1"
"504160","508640"," Now, I want 100% of your mental energy on I'm not trying.","Speaker 1"
"508940","510960"," All of your attention on I'm not trying.","Speaker 1"
"511299","514059"," Then we look at the next bit and we forget I'm not trying.","Speaker 1"
"514200","515740"," Once we've said it, we don't need to hold it.","Speaker 1"
"516020","516700"," I'm not trying.","Speaker 1"
"519100","520500"," To justify myself.","Speaker 1"
"523740","524860"," Good, we can forget that bit.","Speaker 1"
"525420","536000"," But I want to explain you something.","Speaker 1"
"537480","538500"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"543940","546140"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"546440","546820"," Well done.","Speaker 1"
