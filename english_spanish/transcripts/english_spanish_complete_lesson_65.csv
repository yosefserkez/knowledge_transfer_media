"631570","632270"," Visitation.","Speaker 1"
"633010","633770"," Visitar.","Speaker 2"
"635410","635790"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"636330","638050"," So did you visit our house?","Speaker 1"
"638210","639730"," Speaking informally.","Speaker 1"
"641910","644330"," Visitaste nuestra casa.","Speaker 2"
"644650","645030"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"645490","646910"," Visitaste nuestra casa.","Speaker 1"
"647950","648430"," Visit our house.","Speaker 1"
"648670","652490"," How would you say we are with our friends?","Speaker 1"
"652730","653770"," How do you think you would say that?","Speaker 1"
"654110","655450"," We are with our friends.","Speaker 1"
"656010","659370"," We are with, what to be do you think we would use?","Speaker 1"
"661310","661810"," Estar.","Speaker 1"
"661970","663950"," Estar because we are with, no?","Speaker 1"
"664310","664810"," Location.","Speaker 1"
"664990","665130"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"665250","667530"," So we are with our friends.","Speaker 1"
"669570","672070"," Estamos con nuestros amigos.","Speaker 2"
"672610","672990"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"673410","674770"," Nuestros amigos.","Speaker 1"
"674990","675170"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"675250","676010"," You make it plural.","Speaker 1"
"677950","678470"," We are with our friends.","Speaker 1"
"678470","680570"," What if we meant all female friends?","Speaker 1"
"682210","685750"," Estamos con nuestras amigas.","Speaker 2"
"685910","686190"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"686390","688950"," Estamos con nuestras amigas.","Speaker 1"
"689470","692670"," How would you say I am with my friends?","Speaker 1"
"693330","694890"," I am with my friends.","Speaker 1"
"696590","699370"," Estoy con, is it mis amigos?","Speaker 2"
"699730","699990"," Yes.","Speaker 1"
"700710","702230"," Estoy con mis amigos.","Speaker 1"
"702930","710830"," So the words for possession, mi, tu, nuestro, can change for number, to match the number.","Speaker 1"
"711370","712910"," Mi amigo, mis amigos.","Speaker 1"
"713330","717810"," And if it ends in O, like nuestro, it can change for gender as well.","Speaker 1"
"718170","721010"," Nuestro amigo, nuestra amiga.","Speaker 1"
"721570","726910"," So we have mi, my, tu, yo, nuestro or nuestra, our.","Speaker 1"
"727470","731730"," For his, her, their, your, speaking formally.","Speaker 1"
"732110","736790"," For all of that we have the same word which is su, su, S-U.","Speaker 1"
"737510","737870"," Su.","Speaker 1"
"738730","741310"," So how would you say I want to go to his house?","Speaker 1"
"741950","743150"," I want to go to his house.","Speaker 1"
"745630","748350"," Quiero ir a su casa.","Speaker 2"
"748550","748790"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"749130","750810"," Quiero ir a su casa.","Speaker 1"
"751130","752430"," I want to go to his house.","Speaker 1"
"752430","754290"," How would you say I want to go to their house?","Speaker 1"
"756650","759570"," Quiero ir a su casa.","Speaker 2"
"759970","760130"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"760350","762830"," Quiero ir a su casa.","Speaker 1"
"763230","764070"," So it's the same.","Speaker 1"
"764590","771130"," If you put it in plural or not, it refers to the things that are possessed, not the possessors.","Speaker 1"
"771330","774830"," So avoid any temptation to say sus because you mean they.","Speaker 1"
"774970","778730"," You're only going to say sus if you're saying houses, for example.","Speaker 1"
"779150","783990"," So if you were to say I want to go to their houses, there you can put it in plural.","Speaker 1"
"784110","784770"," How would that be?","Speaker 1"
"786980","789340"," Quiero ir a sus casas.","Speaker 2"
"789540","789640"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"789820","791780"," Quiero ir a sus casas.","Speaker 1"
"792640","794640"," And I want to go to his houses.","Speaker 1"
"795120","796640"," I want to go to his houses.","Speaker 1"
"798920","802300"," Quiero ir a sus casas.","Speaker 2"
"802500","803620"," Exactly the same.","Speaker 1"
"803920","805420"," Quiero ir a sus casas.","Speaker 1"
"805800","816780"," So these possessive words, mi, tu, nuestro, su, they refer to the thing being possessed rather than the possessor when they're changing.","Speaker 1"
"816780","826880"," If you want to say my own house, if you want to say my own house or my very own house, you can say mi propia casa.","Speaker 1"
"827920","828820"," Like property.","Speaker 1"
"829440","830480"," Mi propia casa.","Speaker 1"
"830960","832120"," Mi propia casa.","Speaker 1"
"832480","832760"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"833100","834660"," How would you say my own car?","Speaker 1"
"836360","837600"," Mi propio auto.","Speaker 1"
"837800","838120"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"838420","839580"," Mi propio auto.","Speaker 1"
"840200","847380"," The word for I in Spanish, not I as in your, I as in the two things in your head, is ojo.","Speaker 1"
"847720","848040"," Ojo.","Speaker 1"
"848220","849560"," O-J-O.","Speaker 1"
"849740","850100"," Ojo.","Speaker 1"
"850700","851240"," Ojo.","Speaker 2"
"851540","851900"," Ojo.","Speaker 1"
"852340","855460"," How would you say my own eyes?","Speaker 1"
"856420","857920"," My own eyes.","Speaker 1"
"860450","861710"," Mi propios ojos.","Speaker 1"
"862210","864470"," There's some kind of disagreement going on in there.","Speaker 1"
"865630","865990"," Mis.","Speaker 2"
"866250","867990"," Mis propios ojos.","Speaker 1"
"868290","868530"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"868830","871830"," So I saw it with my own eyes.","Speaker 1"
"872030","873890"," I saw it with my own eyes.","Speaker 1"
"876100","880500"," Lo vi con mis propios ojos.","Speaker 2"

"884780","885440"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"886160","888640"," How would you say I want to live in my own house?","Speaker 1"
"889240","891140"," I want to live in my own house.","Speaker 1"
"893340","897420"," Quiero vivir en mi propio casa.","Speaker 2"
"897940","899000"," Mi propia casa.","Speaker 2"
"899180","899460"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"899820","901860"," Quiero vivir en mi propia casa.","Speaker 1"
"902120","902300"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"902340","903960"," I want to live in my own house.","Speaker 1"
"903960","904520"," Good.","Speaker 1"
