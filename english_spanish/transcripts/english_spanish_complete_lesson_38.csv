"580","5860"," So, we said that LO and LA and LOS and LAS become LE and LES.","Speaker 1"
"6560","7660"," The four become two.","Speaker 1"
"8100","15460"," The four options of LO, LA, LOS, LAS become LE and LES, when it's to him, to her, for him, for her.","Speaker 1"
"15800","19740"," And we said that ME, TE and NOS, they don't change to get these different meanings.","Speaker 1"
"20140","21060"," They stay as they are.","Speaker 1"
"21500","30220"," And we also saw that these words, ME, TE and NOS, can mean myself, yourself, ourselves or each other.","Speaker 1"
"30640","33000"," So, how would you say, I speak to myself?","Speaker 1"
"34340","35460"," Me hablo.","Speaker 1"
"35720","37200"," We speak to ourselves?","Speaker 1"
"39600","40720"," Nos hablamos.","Speaker 2"
"40840","41820"," Nos hablamos.","Speaker 1"
"41920","50600"," Although, of course, the more natural meaning you would probably understand from Nos hablamos is we speak to each other, as NOS also means each other.","Speaker 1"
"51420","66740"," Now, to get the meaning of himself, herself, themselves, LO and LA and LOS and LAS become SE, which is very easy to remember because it's the beginning of self.","Speaker 1"
"67340","71720"," So when we want this meaning of self or selves, we get SE.","Speaker 1"
"72480","81020"," So, to recap, ME, TE and NOS, they already have the meanings included of myself, yourself, ourselves, each other.","Speaker 1"
"81280","92640"," But these ones that change, these small words that change, LO, LA, LOS and LAS, to get the meaning of himself, herself, themselves, it's going to be SE.","Speaker 1"
"93120","94520"," So let's practice it.","Speaker 1"
"94780","96560"," He speaks to himself.","Speaker 1"
"96920","97800"," How would you say that?","Speaker 1"
"99760","100680"," Se habla.","Speaker 2"
"102080","103400"," You could say the word for he.","Speaker 1"
"103540","104500"," What is the word for he?","Speaker 1"
"106720","106960"," El.","Speaker 2"
"107240","108960"," El se habla.","Speaker 2"
"108960","110020"," El se habla.","Speaker 1"
"110880","115020"," She speaks to herself and clarify, use the word for she.","Speaker 1"
"117020","117220"," Ella.","Speaker 2"
"117440","118520"," Ella se habla.","Speaker 2"
"118740","119360"," Ella se habla.","Speaker 1"
"119860","120180"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"120900","122280"," They speak to themselves.","Speaker 1"
"123600","124700"," Se hablan.","Speaker 2"
"124900","125540"," Se hablan.","Speaker 1"
"125880","126320"," Se habla.","Speaker 1"
"126780","127440"," Se hablan.","Speaker 1"
"127880","129600"," This SE is not changing.","Speaker 1"
"130940","132080"," I speak to myself.","Speaker 1"
"134020","134500"," Me hablo.","Speaker 2"
"134700","135260"," Me hablo.","Speaker 1"
"135380","135660"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"135660","137240"," So here we are not using SE.","Speaker 1"
"137440","142040"," For ME, TE and NOS, we have all of the meanings included in ME, TE and NOS.","Speaker 1"
"142280","142540"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"143180","144820"," Tell me again, how is they speak?","Speaker 1"
"146360","146780"," Hablan.","Speaker 2"
"147620","149380"," Good, but the accent was...","Speaker 1"
"149380","149680"," Hablan.","Speaker 2"
"149840","150260"," Hablan.","Speaker 1"
"150920","151900"," They speak to them.","Speaker 1"
"152020","153660"," Now a different them, not themselves.","Speaker 1"
"154160","155160"," They speak to them.","Speaker 1"
"155280","157080"," This group is speaking to another group.","Speaker 1"
"158860","159820"," Les hablan.","Speaker 2"
"159820","163660"," So now we can go back to a verb like to stay.","Speaker 1"
"163860","165680"," To remain was QUEDAR.","Speaker 1"
"165880","168300"," So to get the meaning of stay, you say I remain myself.","Speaker 1"
"168560","169460"," So how was that?","Speaker 1"
"171120","171860"," Me quedo.","Speaker 2"
"172000","172280"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"172620","173240"," Me quedo.","Speaker 1"
"173900","176240"," We remain ourselves, so we stay.","Speaker 1"
"177940","178740"," Nos quedamos.","Speaker 2"
"179600","180280"," Our verb.","Speaker 1"
"180800","182080"," Nos quedamos.","Speaker 1"
"182200","183080"," Nos quedamos.","Speaker 1"
"183320","183640"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"184260","188640"," And you stay, talking informally, you remain yourself.","Speaker 1"
"190500","191700"," Te quedas.","Speaker 1"
"191880","192460"," Are you staying?","Speaker 1"
"193920","194760"," Te quedas.","Speaker 2"
"194940","195880"," Aren't you staying?","Speaker 1"
"197300","198740"," No te quedas.","Speaker 2"
"198900","200480"," Why don't you stay?","Speaker 1"
"200720","202120"," Por qué no te quedas?","Speaker 2"
"202280","202480"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"202960","204340"," Por qué no te quedas?","Speaker 1"
"204600","204860"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"206180","210220"," Let's just practice the words for emphasis as well.","Speaker 1"
"210420","213080"," So you could say I am staying.","Speaker 1"
"213280","214280"," What is the word for I?","Speaker 1"
"215960","216280"," Yo.","Speaker 1"
"216500","216800"," Yo.","Speaker 1"
"216920","217700"," I am staying.","Speaker 1"
"217700","219280"," I am remaining myself.","Speaker 1"
"221390","222750"," Yo me quedo.","Speaker 2"
"222890","223670"," Yo me quedo.","Speaker 1"
"223830","223970"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"224310","225690"," What was the word for we?","Speaker 1"
"226190","227470"," Not us, but we.","Speaker 1"
"229290","229950"," Nosotros.","Speaker 1"
"230230","230750"," Nosotros.","Speaker 1"
"231010","232510"," So we have nosotros for we.","Speaker 1"
"232710","236030"," How would you say we are staying, we are remaining ourselves?","Speaker 1"
"238630","240910"," Nosotros nos quedamos.","Speaker 2"
"241050","241250"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"241670","243450"," Nosotros nos quedamos.","Speaker 1"
"243450","247950"," And if you are an all-female group, nosotros will change.","Speaker 1"
"249430","249720"," Nosotras.","Speaker 2"
"250130","250430"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"251150","254070"," Nosotras nos quedamos if you are all-female group.","Speaker 1"
"254450","262450"," What is the word for you in the sense of if we want to clarify or emphasize you are staying, speaking informally?","Speaker 1"
"263530","265450"," Not te, but tú.","Speaker 1"
"266190","266370"," Tú.","Speaker 1"
"266810","267290"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"267490","270790"," So how would you say you are staying, emphasizing that we mean you?","Speaker 1"
"272390","273790"," Tú te quedas.","Speaker 1"
"273930","274950"," Tú te quedas.","Speaker 1"
"275290","275510"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"276170","280110"," So these were the versions actually we were practicing before with me, te and nos.","Speaker 1"
"280330","286750"," We didn't look at he stays, because actually what we needed to say he stays is he remains himself.","Speaker 1"
"287110","289210"," And we didn't have that yet, but now we do.","Speaker 1"
"290650","292030"," Se, and it's queda.","Speaker 2"
"292390","292650"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"293050","293390"," That's it.","Speaker 1"
"293850","294630"," Se queda.","Speaker 1"
"295030","295690"," He stays.","Speaker 1"
"295910","296530"," She stays.","Speaker 1"
"296710","297110"," You stay.","Speaker 1"
"297110","300310"," They stay or they remain themselves?","Speaker 1"
"302810","303770"," Se quedan.","Speaker 1"
"303850","304690"," Se quedan.","Speaker 1"
"305130","305370"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"306090","308370"," Querer was to want.","Speaker 1"
"308890","309190"," Querer.","Speaker 1"
"309570","310630"," What was I want?","Speaker 1"
"312090","312510"," Quiero.","Speaker 2"
"312750","313270"," Quiero.","Speaker 1"
"313650","317070"," The e of querer splits when we put the stress on it.","Speaker 1"
"317250","317670"," Quiero.","Speaker 1"
"318170","323670"," Now if you want to say I want to stay, you say I want to remain myself.","Speaker 1"
"324210","324910"," So how is that?","Speaker 1"
"326990","328270"," Quiero quedarme.","Speaker 2"
"328270","328790"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"329230","330590"," Quiero quedarme.","Speaker 1"
"331210","335090"," He wants to remain himself or she wants to remain herself?","Speaker 1"
"335310","336210"," He wants to stay.","Speaker 1"
"336350","337330"," She wants to stay.","Speaker 1"
"339590","340710"," Quiere quedarse.","Speaker 2"
"340930","341170"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"341390","342170"," Quiere quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"342730","343910"," She wants to stay.","Speaker 1"
"344110","345270"," Ella quiere quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"345510","346510"," He wants to stay.","Speaker 1"
"346850","348070"," Él quiere quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"348570","349830"," You former want to stay.","Speaker 1"
"350310","352110"," Usted quiere quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"352470","356630"," What if you wanted to say they want to stay or you guys want to stay?","Speaker 1"
"358430","359510"," Quieren quedarse.","Speaker 2"
"359830","361010"," Quieren quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"361150","363710"," So this could mean they want to stay or you guys want to stay.","Speaker 1"
"363870","364830"," How would you clarify?","Speaker 1"
"365370","367810"," Let's clarify they want to stay.","Speaker 1"
"369950","372010"," Ellos quieren quedarse.","Speaker 2"
"372210","372470"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"372570","374230"," And what if it was a female group?","Speaker 1"
"376130","378050"," Ellas quieren quedarse.","Speaker 2"
"378250","379690"," Ellas quieren quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"379930","380150"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"380430","381430"," And you guys?","Speaker 1"
"383550","385550"," Ustedes quieren quedarse.","Speaker 2"
"385550","386090"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"386530","388690"," Ustedes quieren quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"389050","396590"," And we said that whilst usted is formal, ustedes, the plural you, is not necessarily formal.","Speaker 1"
"397630","402370"," Quedarse is the version of the verb that you're going to find in the dictionary.","Speaker 1"
"403150","413770"," So in the dictionary, you will find quedar and all of the different meanings of quedar, which is remain, and the various other meanings actually this verb has can be used like to fit.","Speaker 1"
"414130","414850"," Me queda bien.","Speaker 1"
"414850","416110"," It fits me well.","Speaker 1"
"416170","417350"," It suits me well.","Speaker 1"
"417850","419970"," And then you will find the next entry, quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"420970","422850"," And then you will find next to it to stay.","Speaker 1"
"423450","432530"," So when this reflexive, when this doing it to oneself carries a different meaning, it will get a different entry in the dictionary.","Speaker 1"
"433070","438070"," And it's not going to be in the dictionary as quedarme or quedarte or quedarnos, but quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"438350","440310"," Because this se is also like oneself.","Speaker 1"
"440310","440850"," No?","Speaker 1"
"441630","442750"," If it's himself, herself.","Speaker 1"
"442970","444890"," Itself is also like oneself.","Speaker 1"
"445310","448530"," So in the dictionary, what you find is to remain oneself.","Speaker 1"
"448870","449350"," Quedarse.","Speaker 1"
"449690","452390"," The se is written like one word.","Speaker 1"
"452530","460270"," Whenever we put se, lo, me, te, nos, one of these small words, at the end of the two form, it's written like one word.","Speaker 1"
"460450","461330"," We write it all together.","Speaker 1"
"462150","465050"," Let's practice this just with one more verb.","Speaker 1"
"465050","475710"," We said that to get the sense of realize, I realize, in Spanish you say to give yourself a count, which is a little bit like to take account of in English.","Speaker 1"
"476230","482030"," Now you need to look at darse cuenta and know how to manipulate it to get the different versions of it that you might want.","Speaker 1"
"482410","484270"," So let's begin with I realize.","Speaker 1"
"484710","485410"," I realize.","Speaker 1"
"485690","488190"," I give myself a count.","Speaker 1"
"491770","492470"," That's it.","Speaker 1"
"492650","493210"," Me doy cuenta.","Speaker 1"
"493210","494270"," I don't realize.","Speaker 1"
"495650","498270"," No me doy cuenta.","Speaker 1"
"498430","498890"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"499610","502990"," We realize or we give ourselves a count.","Speaker 1"
"507630","509030"," Nos damos cuenta.","Speaker 1"
"509350","509550"," Perfect.","Speaker 1"
"509730","510570"," We don't realize.","Speaker 1"
"514159","514799"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"514980","516760"," No nos damos cuenta.","Speaker 1"
"517600","524740"," Now we can make the other versions with he, she, it and you formal and they and you guys because we have se.","Speaker 1"
"524920","525960"," So now we can do this.","Speaker 1"
"526360","529340"," So how would you say he realizes or she realizes?","Speaker 1"
"530760","531820"," Go back to dar.","Speaker 1"
"535360","535560"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"537100","539140"," What if we wanted to clarify she.","Speaker 1"
"539540","540300"," She realizes.","Speaker 1"
"543500","543880"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"546300","546780"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"546900","547880"," And they realize.","Speaker 1"
"551420","551860"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"551860","553680"," And they don't realize.","Speaker 1"
"555420","558300"," No se dan cuenta.","Speaker 2"
"558560","563220"," So this could be they don't realize or you guys don't realize.","Speaker 1"
"563720","564240"," Well done.","Speaker 1"
