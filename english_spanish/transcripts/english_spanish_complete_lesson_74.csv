"1610","10070"," So, we've been seeing the obligatory uses of the mood tense, and we will continue to look at some of these uses.","Speaker 1"
"10590","25390"," To choose is elegir, elegir, which sounds a little bit like elect, yes, elect, related to elect, election in Spanish is elección.","Speaker 1"
"26030","31390"," I choose from elegir is el hijo, el hijo, so what happened there?","Speaker 1"
"33190","34410"," The E became E.","Speaker 1"
"34650","55970"," Yes, the E or the F sound became an I or an I sound, so instead of splitting this E just turns into an I, and that happens sometimes in Spanish with a few verbs, when we stress the E instead of splitting it will just turn into an I, so here we have el hijo, and it's just when we stress it, so how would you say we choose from elegir?","Speaker 1"
"58360","58920"," Elegimos.","Speaker 1"
"59240","64300"," Elegimos, good, so there the E is not turning into an I because we're not stressing it,","Speaker 1"
"64640","70380"," elegimos, but in the other places where we stress it, it will, so we have el hijo, you,","Speaker 1"
"70760","80460"," informal, you choose, eliges, eliges, good, so how would you say I don't want you to choose","Speaker 1"
"80460","87840"," for me, now when for means on my behalf, I don't want you to choose for me, I don't want","Speaker 1"
"87840","94480"," you to choose on my behalf, the for that we use is por, but maybe we don't mean on my behalf,","Speaker 1"
"94840","101440"," maybe we mean I don't want you to choose something for me, literally something that is for me,","Speaker 1"
"101660","107380"," so in that case we would use para, but let's make the sentence like on my behalf, I don't","Speaker 1"
"107380","112660"," want you to choose for me, I don't want you to choose on my behalf, speaking informally.","Speaker 1"
"117540","124200"," Very good, no quiero que elijas por mi, good, so por me is like on my behalf, I don't want you","Speaker 1"
"124200","132460"," to take my decisions, no quiero que elijas por mi, to break was romper or romperse,","Speaker 1"
"132460","139460"," if we say something breaks without saying who breaks it, we said that the romper was related","Speaker 1"
"139460","147380"," to rupture in English, which also means it's related to corrupt, the rupt of corrupt is rupture,","Speaker 1"
"147980","154420"," disrupt, erupt, so romper is to break, how would you say I don't want it to break,","Speaker 1"
"154420","156320"," I don't want it to break,","Speaker 1"
"160320","165700"," if you say no quiero que rompa, I'm waiting to hear what you don't want it to break,","Speaker 1"
"168560","174100"," well that would be a different sentence, good, if you were to say no quiero que lo rompa,","Speaker 1"
"174380","179180"," it would mean I don't want him or her to break it, or you formal to break it,","Speaker 1"
"179180","184500"," if you say no quiero que se rompa, we're not saying who, we're just saying I don't want it","Speaker 1"
"184500","190300"," to break, I don't want it to break itself, even though we don't literally mean itself,","Speaker 1"
"190920","200200"," we said that we can use para for para, we can use para like to when it's in order to,","Speaker 1"
"200700","207480"," so when we have a to in English, which implies in order to, we should put para in Spanish,","Speaker 1"
"208120","210040"," what was to find,","Speaker 1"
"216900","224260"," to find oneself, is to meet up, to meet up, so how would you say we have met up,","Speaker 1"
"224520","230540"," or we have found ourselves, or each other, which is the same word in Spanish,","Speaker 1"
"235280","241500"," good, nos hemos encontrado, we have met up, so we have met up in order to speak,","Speaker 1"
"241500","245160"," we have met up to speak, we have met up in order to speak,","Speaker 1"
"250700","258240"," good, nos hemos encontrado para hablar, so we have met up to speak, and although we wouldn't","Speaker 1"
"258240","263420"," say in order to speak usually in English if that to speak implies in order to","Speaker 1"
"263420","266140"," speak then we will put para in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"266640","269520"," Nos hemos encontrado para hablar.","Speaker 1"
"270240","277020"," But after para que, so that, para que, you must use the mood tense.","Speaker 1"
"277880","281560"," We have cooked in order that they eat.","Speaker 1"
"281840","283540"," We have cooked so they eat.","Speaker 1"
"285650","288650"," Hemos cocinado para que coman.","Speaker 2"
"288650","289170"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"289810","291970"," Hemos cocinado para que coman.","Speaker 1"
"292310","292430"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"292530","294150"," We have cooked so that they eat.","Speaker 1"
"294510","297010"," And you can't make the shortcut there of para comer.","Speaker 1"
"297470","303770"," Hemos cocinado para comer because of course it would just sound like we have cooked in order to eat, in order for us to eat.","Speaker 1"
"304370","304750"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"305950","311350"," To go back or to return is volver, volver, volver.","Speaker 1"
"312570","314170"," Like in revolve.","Speaker 1"
"314370","322970"," The vol of revolve is volver and exists in Spanish revolver but in Spanish revolver means to stir.","Speaker 1"
"323730","324250"," Revolver.","Speaker 1"
"324550","328410"," So volver is to return or to go back or to come back.","Speaker 1"
"329010","333090"," How do you think you would say I return, I come back or go back?","Speaker 1"
"335130","335530"," Vuelvo.","Speaker 2"
"336050","336510"," Vuelvo.","Speaker 2"
"336770","337370"," Vuelvo.","Speaker 1"
"337570","337830"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"337950","338730"," The O splits.","Speaker 1"
"338950","339370"," Vuelvo.","Speaker 1"
"339870","343570"," How would you say you come back or you go back speaking informally?","Speaker 1"

"361290","362890"," Para que vuelvas.","Speaker 2"
"363150","363470"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"363650","364950"," Para que vuelvas.","Speaker 1"
"365270","369230"," So you could say something like I've done it so that you come back.","Speaker 1"
"369370","371190"," I've done it so that you come back.","Speaker 1"
"371910","379010"," So I have done, the version of hacer after haber, after any version of haber, is hecho.","Speaker 1"
"379390","386630"," It's very irregular and we said the hecho, the version of hacer after haber also means fact.","Speaker 1"
"387130","389810"," So I have done, how is it?","Speaker 1"

"439000","443680"," And I should mention that you might hear para shortened down in Spanish to pa.","Speaker 1"

"447760","450880"," How much this happens or if it happens at all depends on dialect.","Speaker 1"
"451200","452420"," So you will notice it.","Speaker 1"

"472760","475300"," The n turned to an m because of that b.","Speaker 1"
"475500","476260"," It softened it.","Speaker 1"

"487660","490260"," And then well from as well, bien.","Speaker 1"
"490640","494420"," So interestingly, they are like direct translations of each other.","Speaker 1"
"494520","498660"," Even though if you think about it, the direct translation doesn't make any sense.","Speaker 1"
"499020","499820"," As well.","Speaker 1"
