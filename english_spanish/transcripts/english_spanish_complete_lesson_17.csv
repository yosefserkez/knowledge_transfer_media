"1100","7760"," So, we've seen how two sounds in the verbs in the present tense might split when we put pressure on them.","Speaker 1"
"8100","18580"," We've seen how i might become ie, so for example we have querer, which means to want, but I want is quiero.","Speaker 1"
"19320","22320"," So we stress down on that i and it splits into ie.","Speaker 1"
"23200","43380"," And this will happen for the other versions that we learned as well, so how do you say he wants, or she wants, or you formal want, quiere, they want, quieren, good, and you informal quieres, good, what do you want, que quieres, yeah, que quieres, good.","Speaker 1"
"43800","51140"," So another example where this will happen is with the verb perder, which means to lose, it's related to perish.","Speaker 1"
"51140","67900"," So how would you say I lose, pierdo, good, and he loses, she loses, pierde, they pierden, good, and you informal pierdes, good.","Speaker 1"
"68560","80340"," So we saw that the e can split into ie, and we also saw that an o in the base of the verb can split into ue.","Speaker 1"
"80720","87840"," So we saw for example poder is to be able, and then we have puedo, I can, I am able.","Speaker 1"
"88980","98180"," We had dormir, what did dormir mean, to sleep, good, and duermo, I sleep, good.","Speaker 1"
"98580","107340"," What changed when we added me, me duermo, I think it's I fall asleep, yes, I sleep myself, I fall asleep, good.","Speaker 1"
"107920","112220"," So we can expect to see these o's split, but not always.","Speaker 1"
"112340","121260"," For example, to eat was, to eat, comer, and I eat, como, so it didn't split there.","Speaker 1"
"121560","131780"," So there's no way to know where it will, where it won't, most of the time it will, and you just have to kind of experiment and see what happens, and you will always get the feedback when you try to see if it splits or not.","Speaker 1"
"131780","135320"," You will also develop an intuition of where you should do it.","Speaker 1"
"136040","139720"," So colgar, for example, is to hang.","Speaker 1"
"140460","157640"," So if you want to say I hang, cuelgo, good, he hangs, cuelge, no it's colgar, good, so it's cuelga, why do you think you said cuelge first?","Speaker 1"
"157640","166320"," Well, the reason you explained before with the, it sounds like, because it has a me sound before, it seems to go more.","Speaker 2"
"166560","173620"," Exactly, it fits more, so you will find yourself doing that, how do you get out of doing that, how do you stop that happening?","Speaker 1"
"174660","178700"," By going back to the to version of the verb.","Speaker 2"
"178820","181040"," Exactly, and then you're in control.","Speaker 1"
"181660","184380"," Colgar, adverb, cuelga, good.","Speaker 1"
"184780","185480"," They hang?","Speaker 1"
"186680","187240"," Cuelgan.","Speaker 1"
"187240","188660"," Good, they hang it?","Speaker 1"
"190140","190660"," No cuelgan.","Speaker 1"
"190760","191600"," No cuelgan.","Speaker 1"
"191980","192840"," They hang them?","Speaker 1"
"194600","195440"," Los cuelgan.","Speaker 2"
"195680","197100"," Good, she hangs them?","Speaker 1"
"198440","199420"," Los cuelga.","Speaker 2"
"199680","200920"," Good, los cuelga.","Speaker 1"
"201740","211540"," Words in English that begin al, so not end al, like normal, normal, metal, metal, they begin al, they come from Arabic.","Speaker 1"
"212400","220700"," This al means the in Arabic, and in Arabic it's written with the word, it's written as one word, it's all stuck together.","Speaker 1"
"220940","226240"," So when words came in from Arabic, they kind of came in most of the time with this al, which meant the.","Speaker 1"
"226520","233900"," So for example, alcohol, and when we say the alcohol, we are actually saying something like the alcohol, something like this.","Speaker 1"
"233900","239780"," The verb to take is tomar, tomar, t-o-m-a-r.","Speaker 1"
"239880","249120"," And this is also used like to drink, so it's used like take, generically, generally, but also to drink.","Speaker 1"
"250280","254780"," How would you say, I don't drink alcohol, I don't take alcohol?","Speaker 1"
"256220","258360"," No tomo alcohol.","Speaker 2"
"258579","260240"," Good, no tomo alcohol.","Speaker 1"
"260980","267380"," Sugar, in Spanish is azúcar, azúcar, azúcar, azúcar.","Speaker 1"
"267880","271760"," Or in Spain, because we have a Z here, it would be azúcar in most of Spain.","Speaker 1"
"272200","278100"," Now this is also an Arabic word, and it's the same word as sugar, in English, might not look like it.","Speaker 1"
"278780","279740"," What's happened here?","Speaker 1"
"280200","290360"," In Arabic, the el of al, the word for the, assimilates, changes to match the next letter, if the next letter is kind of close to it.","Speaker 1"
"290440","291820"," It does this with about half the letters.","Speaker 1"
"292360","296160"," So in Arabic, actually, instead of al azúcar, you say azúcar.","Speaker 1"
"296900","298500"," And this passed into Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"298900","302080"," But in English, we got the word without the the at the beginning this time.","Speaker 1"
"302240","310580"," This time, sugar came in without the the at the beginning, so they look kind of different, and sound rather different, sugar, azúcar, but again, they're the same word.","Speaker 1"
"310960","312360"," So how would you say, I don't take sugar?","Speaker 1"
"314520","315920"," No tomo azúcar.","Speaker 2"
"315920","316320"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"316680","317900"," No tomo azúcar.","Speaker 1"
"318960","322380"," Arroz, rice, is also an Arabic word.","Speaker 1"
"323080","325680"," It's actually al ruz, the rice.","Speaker 1"
"326140","332780"," But again, in Spanish, the el assimilated to the next R, as it does in Arabic.","Speaker 1"
"333580","339040"," And instead of al ruz, like in Arabic, arroz, we ended up with arroz.","Speaker 1"
"339400","340420"," So it's two R's?","Speaker 2"
"340580","341060"," Two R's.","Speaker 1"
"341300","344000"," So it's azúcar, azúcar, with two S's?","Speaker 2"
"344000","350360"," No, it's with a Z here, because two S's are not a combination you find in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"350540","357680"," So for example, in the word possible, we have two S's there in English, but in Spanish, when we write posible, we write one S.","Speaker 1"
"357960","362480"," The same with passion, we write one S in Spanish, pasión.","Speaker 1"
"362900","369720"," So you don't get two S's together in Spanish, but you do get two R's together to differentiate between the normal R and the rolling R.","Speaker 1"
"370100","372280"," So in Spanish, we have arroz.","Speaker 1"
"372920","378080"," It's just a simulation of al ruz, arroz, to Spanish arroz.","Speaker 1"
"378420","380260"," And it's the same word as English, rice.","Speaker 1"
"381220","382320"," So how do you say I want rice?","Speaker 1"
"383980","384860"," Quiero arroz.","Speaker 2"
"385000","385820"," Quiero arroz.","Speaker 1"
"386080","386300"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"387000","387440"," Álgebra.","Speaker 1"
"388040","389280"," How would that be in Spanish?","Speaker 1"
"390780","391380"," Álgebra.","Speaker 1"
"392460","393060"," Álgebra.","Speaker 1"
"394040","394440"," Álgebra.","Speaker 1"
"394700","394980"," Álgebra.","Speaker 1"
"394980","395260"," Álgebra.","Speaker 1"
"395560","395900"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"396660","398860"," Spanish has a lot more Arabic than English.","Speaker 1"
"398860","403560"," The south of Spain was part of the Muslim world for 800 years.","Speaker 1"
"403820","405580"," So the languages had a lot of contact.","Speaker 1"
"405920","409660"," And you get more words in Spanish that you don't have in English that are from Arabic.","Speaker 1"
"409840","412840"," So for example, aceite, oil.","Speaker 1"
"413400","415800"," In Arabic, this is zayt, aceite.","Speaker 1"
"417920","419120"," Aceituna, olive.","Speaker 1"
"419360","421380"," Zaytoon, zaytoon in Arabic.","Speaker 1"
"422320","423980"," Alfombra, which means carpet.","Speaker 1"
"424400","426560"," Almuada, which means pillow.","Speaker 1"
"426560","428740"," All of these words, they came in from Arabic.","Speaker 1"
"428880","433440"," When you find a L at the beginning, with maybe a couple of exceptions, it's from Arabic.","Speaker 1"
"434380","436340"," So we said I take is tomo.","Speaker 1"
"436740","440780"," How is he take, she take, it takes, you formal take?","Speaker 1"
"442360","442760"," Toma.","Speaker 2"
"443020","443420"," Toma.","Speaker 1"
"443640","443860"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"444260","446220"," You informal, talking to a friend?","Speaker 1"
"447620","448020"," Tomas.","Speaker 2"
"448200","448400"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"448500","449640"," How would you say what are you taking?","Speaker 1"
"449820","452560"," This could be a way to ask what do you want to drink?","Speaker 1"
"453980","454640"," Que tomas.","Speaker 2"
"454780","455400"," Que tomas.","Speaker 1"
"455400","456680"," The drink exists.","Speaker 1"
"457060","458500"," It's beber, beber.","Speaker 1"
"458960","463520"," And the word drink, the noun, una bebida, a drink.","Speaker 1"
"463920","466020"," Una, we have a for feminine words.","Speaker 1"
"466420","469200"," Una bebida or la bebida, the drink, comes from beber.","Speaker 1"
"469880","472120"," But tomar, to take, is extremely common.","Speaker 1"
"474100","475140"," They take?","Speaker 1"
"476400","476960"," Toman.","Speaker 1"
"477240","477720"," Toman.","Speaker 1"
"478120","478600"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"479180","484660"," Now there's one more version of the verbs that we didn't learn yet, which was the we version.","Speaker 1"
"485680","488520"," We didn't learn how to say we want or we have.","Speaker 1"
"489040","491620"," Now, we take is tomamos.","Speaker 1"
"492820","493280"," Tomamos.","Speaker 1"
"493440","496000"," Explain to me what I did then to get we take.","Speaker 1"
"496260","499000"," If I go from tomar to tomamos, what am I doing?","Speaker 1"
"500640","504120"," You took out the ar and put a mos at the end.","Speaker 2"
"504360","506480"," But to make it fit in with your...","Speaker 1"
"506480","509780"," Well, you took out the ar, the ar sound.","Speaker 2"
"509980","510160"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"510320","511799"," And you put in the amos sound.","Speaker 2"
"511799","511940"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"511940","520940"," This is very nice to think about it this way, because then you fit it in with what you've been doing up until now, taking off the ar, ar, and putting on your ending.","Speaker 1"
"521100","524840"," So, you take off ar and you put on amos, and you get the we form.","Speaker 1"
"525380","526940"," So, how is to speak?","Speaker 1"
"528080","528520"," Hablar.","Speaker 2"
"528680","529080"," Hablar.","Speaker 1"
"529380","530260"," And we speak?","Speaker 1"
"531840","532280"," Hablamos.","Speaker 2"
"532500","532940"," Hablamos.","Speaker 1"
"533100","533400"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"533940","540540"," So, with amos, we're adding on two syllables, and the accent is coming on the second last syllable.","Speaker 1"
"540540","545280"," So, it's in a different position, the accent, to the other versions.","Speaker 1"
"545500","552360"," If we look at tomo, toma, toman, tomas, tomamos, the accent's moving.","Speaker 1"
"552680","553860"," Again, to speak?","Speaker 1"
"555180","555600"," Hablar.","Speaker 2"
"555920","556640"," I speak?","Speaker 1"
"557600","558100"," Hablo.","Speaker 2"
"558400","559140"," She speaks?","Speaker 1"
"560640","561340"," Habla.","Speaker 2"
"561620","562040"," Habla.","Speaker 1"
"562320","562960"," They speak?","Speaker 1"
"563640","564180"," Hablan.","Speaker 2"
"564640","566040"," You in formal?","Speaker 1"
"567280","567860"," Hablas.","Speaker 2"
"568060","568220"," We?","Speaker 1"
"569240","569940"," Hablamos.","Speaker 1"
"569940","570860"," Hablamos.","Speaker 1"
"572280","585980"," So, this affects the split of the e or the o in the root of the verb, because we said that it splits because you stress it, but in the we form, we don't actually stress it.","Speaker 1"
"586260","587100"," So, let's look at this.","Speaker 1"
"587520","590560"," What was to find or to encounter?","Speaker 1"
"592800","593320"," Encontrar.","Speaker 1"
"593820","594340"," Encontrar.","Speaker 1"
"594720","595420"," I find?","Speaker 1"
"597980","598500"," Encuentro.","Speaker 1"

"604220","604700"," Encuentra.","Speaker 2"
"605200","605680"," Encuentra.","Speaker 1"
"605840","606200"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"606580","608400"," You went back to the to form, right?","Speaker 1"
"608620","608800"," Yeah.","Speaker 2"
"610040","610340"," They?","Speaker 1"
"612700","613180"," Encuentran.","Speaker 2"
"613420","613720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"613880","615700"," And you in formal?","Speaker 1"
"617660","618140"," Encuentras.","Speaker 2"
"618300","618540"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"618740","622140"," Now, we, you're not stressing that o anymore, so it's safe.","Speaker 1"
"622360","623280"," It's not going to split.","Speaker 1"
"625500","625980"," Encontramos.","Speaker 2"
"626200","626740"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"627360","627840"," Encontramos.","Speaker 1"
"628000","629540"," We don't stress it, so it doesn't split.","Speaker 1"
"629540","632460"," What was demonstration?","Speaker 1"
"638280","640140"," So, how would you say to demonstrate?","Speaker 1"
"641980","642420"," Demostrar.","Speaker 1"
"643000","643440"," Demostrar.","Speaker 1"
"643580","649500"," If you take away this de, which actually means of in Spanish, if you get rid of it, you're left with mostrar.","Speaker 1"
"649680","650800"," And what does mostrar mean?","Speaker 1"
"651080","651560"," To show.","Speaker 1"
"651740","652200"," To show.","Speaker 1"
"653000","654280"," I show or I'm showing?","Speaker 1"
"656480","656920"," Mostro.","Speaker 1"
"657140","658640"," It should be mostro, but...","Speaker 1"
"658640","659120"," Mostro.","Speaker 1"

"677020","680160"," You're not accenting any more that o, so it doesn't split.","Speaker 1"
"680360","680860"," Mostramos.","Speaker 1"
"681300","683480"," How do you say to think?","Speaker 1"
"683560","685620"," And we said it's related to the word pensive.","Speaker 1"
"686880","687440"," Pensar.","Speaker 1"
