"20600","24580"," I give them, los doy, good.","Speaker 1"
"24620","26640"," And what if they were feminine things that you were giving?","Speaker 1"

"84510","87350"," Me dan algo, good.","Speaker 2"

"88830","93190"," Now if you want to say they give it to me, they give it to me.","Speaker 1"
"93370","95790"," In Spanish you would just say they give me it.","Speaker 1"
"96350","101270"," The personal word me is going to come first and then it is going to come.","Speaker 1"
"101530","103750"," And the position where they go we know this already.","Speaker 1"

"126890","131370"," We said that with some future context, we don't need to use the future.","Speaker 1"
"132330","138870"," So if you want to say I will give it to you tomorrow, you can just say I give it to you tomorrow.","Speaker 1"
"139370","140390"," Let's talk informally.","Speaker 1"
"140830","143930"," So informally, how will you say I give you it tomorrow?","Speaker 1"
"146660","149480"," Te lo doy mañana.","Speaker 2"
"151260","154380"," Very common, very Spanish sounding sentence.","Speaker 1"
"154520","155340"," Te lo doy mañana.","Speaker 1"
"155740","156880"," I give you it tomorrow.","Speaker 1"
"157080","159000"," Sounds strange in English but perfect Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"159180","159880"," Te lo doy mañana.","Speaker 1"
"160480","163380"," How would you say are you giving it to me tomorrow?","Speaker 1"
"163600","164720"," And let's speak formally.","Speaker 1"
"165320","167240"," So complicated sentence in English.","Speaker 1"
"167380","169180"," Are you giving it to me tomorrow?","Speaker 1"
"169340","172140"," All we have to do in Spanish is just work out who's doing what.","Speaker 1"
"172920","174880"," We work out who's doing what and to who.","Speaker 1"
"175620","177400"," It's very simple in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"177600","180140"," Complicated sentence in English but not in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"180600","181680"," Talking formally.","Speaker 1"
"182120","183680"," Are you giving it to me tomorrow?","Speaker 1"
"185860","186780"," Well, it's da.","Speaker 2"
"187400","189280"," That's the first thing you should work out, good.","Speaker 1"
"189960","193180"," Me lo da mañana.","Speaker 2"
"193600","193980"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"194220","196820"," Now what if we wanted to emphasize you?","Speaker 1"
"197440","199940"," Are you giving it to me tomorrow?","Speaker 1"
"202150","204990"," And usted can come in the beginning or the end.","Speaker 2"
"205070","205330"," Yeah.","Speaker 1"
"205950","208250"," So usted me lo da mañana.","Speaker 2"
"208470","209770"," Usted me lo da mañana.","Speaker 1"
"210090","211530"," Me lo da usted mañana.","Speaker 1"
"211970","213230"," Me lo da mañana usted.","Speaker 1"
"213690","218390"," These words usted, yo, el, ella are extremely flexible for different emphases.","Speaker 1"
"218670","237490"," Again, it's not something we want to teach here because those nuances of emphasis change depending on the dialect and it's something that you pick up in real life because where people move it around is accompanied with a change in the voice and hand expressions and you understand, in this case intuitively, which is emphatic.","Speaker 1"
"238870","241850"," You guys is usted but plural.","Speaker 1"
"242610","247790"," Now if the word ends in a consonant in Spanish, you don't just add s, you add es.","Speaker 1"
"249030","250970"," So how would it sound, you guys?","Speaker 1"
"252610","253210"," Ustedes.","Speaker 1"
"253550","254150"," Ustedes.","Speaker 1"
"254470","254730"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"255089","260350"," So now let's say, will you guys give it to us tomorrow?","Speaker 1"
"260350","267150"," So again, we just want to work out who's doing and to who or to what are they doing and then we can construct it.","Speaker 1"
"267290","270610"," So are you guys giving it to us tomorrow?","Speaker 1"
"271870","272870"," So it's tan.","Speaker 2"
"273450","273910"," Yes.","Speaker 1"
"274610","276910"," It's nos and it's still lo.","Speaker 2"
"277050","277330"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"278510","281270"," Nos lo tan mañana.","Speaker 2"
"281550","281730"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"282110","288090"," Now this could mean you guys or they give it to us tomorrow.","Speaker 1"
"288090","291510"," Now what if you wanted to clarify that it was you guys?","Speaker 1"
"296110","296630"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"302910","305030"," How do you say I want to give?","Speaker 1"
"307490","308690"," I want to give.","Speaker 2"
"308830","309190"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"309730","311270"," I want to give you it.","Speaker 1"
"311590","312810"," Talking informally.","Speaker 1"
"313810","315410"," I want to give it to you.","Speaker 1"
"318250","319830"," Work out the verbs first.","Speaker 1"
"320290","321370"," I want to give.","Speaker 1"
"321450","322430"," Work that out first.","Speaker 1"
"325650","326170"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"326970","328610"," To give you is something else.","Speaker 1"
"328710","329490"," It's not you give.","Speaker 1"
"330470","331650"," I want to give.","Speaker 1"
"333010","334290"," It to you.","Speaker 1"
"335150","337370"," So it's lo and it's te.","Speaker 2"
"337590","337970"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"338410","339710"," And in what order did they come?","Speaker 1"
"342510","343030"," Good.","Speaker 2"
