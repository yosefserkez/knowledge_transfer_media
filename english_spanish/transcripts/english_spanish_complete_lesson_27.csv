"214440","215020"," Un carro.","Speaker 1"
"215320","215660"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"215880","219820"," So it's the noun that has the gender, not the object.","Speaker 1"
"220520","223320"," Of course, it's not the car that is masculine or feminine.","Speaker 1"
"223600","224180"," It's the noun.","Speaker 1"
"224300","225180"," It's the word itself.","Speaker 1"

"266320","268340"," So la also became plural.","Speaker 1"
"268960","274760"," So las casas, if you say the big houses, big is also going to become plural.","Speaker 1"
"275780","276380"," Grandes.","Speaker 1"
"276380","278000"," So how would you say the big houses?","Speaker 1"
"279420","280620"," Las casas grandes.","Speaker 2"
"280840","281120"," Good.","Speaker 1"

"290080","296120"," The cars using auto, so a masculine word, you say los autos.","Speaker 1"
"296380","299620"," So el becomes los in plural.","Speaker 1"
"300160","301540"," So how would you say the big cars?","Speaker 1"
"302720","304300"," Los autos grandes.","Speaker 1"
"304520","305980"," Los autos grandes.","Speaker 1"

"313260","315100"," You can say, can you see?","Speaker 1"
"315760","318520"," Or in Spanish, you can just say, do you see?","Speaker 1"
"318940","321600"," We kind of overuse this can a lot in English.","Speaker 1"
"322340","323580"," So do you see the big car?","Speaker 1"
"327180","333700"," You need some time there to look at this.","Speaker 1"
"334680","337760"," And this was the more common way actually of saying in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"340060","346280"," But if you didn't have that time to think about it, even though it's more natural to say like this, it really doesn't matter.","Speaker 1"
"346720","348500"," You could say, can you see?","Speaker 1"
"348820","357100"," Now you would probably be quicker at building can you see than you see, because can is something very common that you're going to be using all the time.","Speaker 1"
"357760","363080"," So in conversation where you just want to get the meaning across, you might want to use this.","Speaker 1"
"363180","365440"," So how would you say, can you see the big car?","Speaker 1"
"368800","369320"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"370380","374120"," So puedo, quiero, tengo, que, debo.","Speaker 1"
"374240","380880"," These verbs that are followed by two versions that you're going to be using a lot, even though the sentence is longer, they are shortcuts.","Speaker 1"
"381500","382840"," They are shortcuts in thought.","Speaker 1"
"383360","389100"," And once you become very confident with that, you're going to start noticing that people will say things differently to you.","Speaker 1"
"389460","393480"," So instead of I can't find it, I don't find it.","Speaker 1"
"393640","396280"," You will notice that yourself and your speech will adjust.","Speaker 1"
"396400","402060"," But at the beginning, what you're trying to do is to be conversational and correct structurally.","Speaker 1"
"402420","409260"," Once you get over that hurdle of being communicative, you're going to start noticing that people will say things differently to you.","Speaker 1"
"409740","413000"," So instead of I can't find it, I don't find it.","Speaker 1"
"413380","416060"," So you could say, I can't find it.","Speaker 1"
"416160","417860"," How would you say, I can't find it?","Speaker 1"
"418000","420060"," What was to find or to encounter?","Speaker 1"
"422340","424680"," So say, I can't find it.","Speaker 1"
"425980","426500"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"426500","432080"," No puedo encontrarlo.","Speaker 1"
"432620","434220"," This would be the shortcut.","Speaker 1"
"434680","444660"," Even though it's longer, it's much easier to build no puedo encontrarlo, because puedo is something you're going to be using all the time, and encontrar is in the to form.","Speaker 1"
"445760","447020"," I don't find it.","Speaker 1"
"447320","448040"," How would that be?","Speaker 1"
"449420","450960"," No lo encuentro.","Speaker 1"
"451000","452120"," No lo encuentro.","Speaker 1"
"452520","452880"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"453460","465520"," So it's very useful to bear in mind these verbs like puedo or debo, which we can use with two forms, which give us a shortcut and allow us to get conversational very quickly.","Speaker 1"
"466020","467660"," What was to remain?","Speaker 1"
"469340","469940"," Quedar.","Speaker 1"
"470240","470540"," Quedar.","Speaker 1"
"470900","471260"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"472080","475120"," And I remain myself is how we get the meaning of I stay.","Speaker 1"
"475240","476320"," So how do you say I stay?","Speaker 1"
"478700","479220"," Quedarme.","Speaker 2"
"479600","480900"," I remain myself.","Speaker 1"
"481340","482600"," I remain myself.","Speaker 1"
"484180","485040"," What's to remain?","Speaker 1"
"485640","485940"," Quedar.","Speaker 2"
"486280","487060"," And what's I remain?","Speaker 1"
"488260","488780"," Quedo.","Speaker 2"
"489360","489700"," Uh-huh.","Speaker 1"
"490360","491240"," What's I remain myself?","Speaker 1"
"491740","492380"," Me quedo.","Speaker 2"
"493260","494040"," What was happening?","Speaker 1"
"494560","500100"," I was thinking, okay, the me should go first, but it can't go first because the verb is in the to form.","Speaker 2"
"500700","503300"," And I just got stuck.","Speaker 2"
"503840","507420"," Where do you start when you're building a sentence with the verb?","Speaker 1"
"507580","509160"," With who's doing that?","Speaker 1"
"509420","511840"," So if you start with that, then it's not in the to form anymore.","Speaker 1"
"512340","514340"," So the order of thought is very important.","Speaker 1"
"514500","515860"," The verb is the backbone.","Speaker 1"
"516340","517919"," That's the first place we want to go.","Speaker 1"
"518220","518559"," Quedo.","Speaker 1"
"518980","519820"," I remain myself.","Speaker 1"
"519980","520500"," Me quedo.","Speaker 1"
"521260","523020"," So me quedo is I stay.","Speaker 1"
"523560","526680"," The word for red in Spanish is rojo.","Speaker 1"
"527140","527580"," Rojo.","Speaker 1"
"527820","530180"," This is spelled R-O-J-O.","Speaker 1"
"530600","531660"," And J is in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"531820","533720"," I pronounced J like this.","Speaker 1"
"533720","534420"," Rojo.","Speaker 1"
"534740","535180"," Rojo.","Speaker 2"
"535520","536620"," And we have the initial R.","Speaker 1"
"537000","539120"," So if you can do it, it will be the rolling R.","Speaker 1"
"539460","539900"," Rojo.","Speaker 1"
"540380","540880"," Rojo.","Speaker 2"
"541220","541540"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"542600","546120"," So how would you say I'm staying in the red car?","Speaker 1"
"546540","548780"," I'm staying in the car red.","Speaker 1"
"548920","550900"," The word for in is en.","Speaker 1"
"551400","551800"," E-N.","Speaker 1"
"552100","553080"," So let's divide it up.","Speaker 1"
"553200","553880"," I'm staying.","Speaker 1"
"554200","555280"," Only think about that bit.","Speaker 1"
