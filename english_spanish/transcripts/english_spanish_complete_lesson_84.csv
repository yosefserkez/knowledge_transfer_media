"1670","8550"," So now we really do have the panorama of all times and moods in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"8790","9990"," So now that's everything.","Speaker 1"
"10470","16830"," That's every tense including both the idea of time and the idea of mood.","Speaker 1"
"17130","30350"," We've learned how to construct them all and we should really listen actively to refresh any knowledge that we might need to refresh through our exposure to Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"31710","43030"," Analysing always what we hear and if you're listening to a song or a movie maybe you just hear the endings of the verbs at the beginning but if you can identify what that ending means that's the important bit.","Speaker 1"
"43690","55670"," In the same way this course has been focused equally on the process that we go through in building our structures in Spanish as it has been focused on content.","Speaker 1"
"56150","78690"," So half of the point of this course has been content, has been teaching you Spanish and the other half has been how to manage Spanish, how to manage these elements that we've learned, how to think about this information and how to relate to information generally in a new way, how to find things that you think you might have forgotten.","Speaker 1"
"79370","84530"," We've also looked now and then at some irregularities in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"85410","90050"," Verbs or other words that don't follow the rules that we learned.","Speaker 1"
"90770","94790"," Now the older the language the more irregularities it tends to have.","Speaker 1"
"95610","107270"," Spanish effectively being modern Latin is quite prone to irregularities but the irregularities can be made sense of within themselves.","Speaker 1"
"107670","109770"," You can group together irregularities.","Speaker 1"
"110110","120810"," So whilst throughout the course we were looking at the odd irregularity as it popped up, now at the end of the course we are going to tidy up the irregular verbs.","Speaker 1"
"121590","125670"," So there are a group of verbs which we can call the GOT verbs.","Speaker 1"
"125970","131510"," These are the verbs that use GOT instead of O for the I form.","Speaker 1"
"132130","137050"," For example how do you say to have, to have, for possession?","Speaker 1"
"138350","138870"," Tener.","Speaker 2"
"139050","139570"," Tener.","Speaker 1"
"139790","140550"," And I have?","Speaker 1"
"141970","142370"," Tengo.","Speaker 2"
"142590","143030"," Tengo.","Speaker 1"
"143510","146990"," So this GOT pops up for the I version but only for the I version.","Speaker 1"
"147650","149330"," How do you say he has or she has?","Speaker 1"
"149410","150130"," You formal have?","Speaker 1"
"151690","152010"," Tiene.","Speaker 2"
"152350","152670"," Tiene.","Speaker 1"
"152670","153970"," And you informal?","Speaker 1"
"155270","155930"," Tienes.","Speaker 1"
"156130","156650"," And they?","Speaker 1"
"158350","159010"," Tienen.","Speaker 1"
"159390","159730"," Tienen.","Speaker 1"
"159970","160470"," And we?","Speaker 1"
"162130","162790"," Tenemos.","Speaker 1"
"163110","163510"," Tenemos.","Speaker 1"
"163970","166670"," So the GOT is only popping up for the I version.","Speaker 1"
"167290","168170"," What was to come?","Speaker 1"
"169870","170470"," Venir.","Speaker 1"
"170650","171130"," Venir.","Speaker 1"
"171250","171570"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"172110","172710"," I come?","Speaker 1"
"174290","174890"," Vengo.","Speaker 2"
"175090","175550"," Vengo.","Speaker 1"
"176070","177870"," So here we have the GOT again.","Speaker 1"
"178390","179310"," But he comes?","Speaker 1"
"180650","181250"," Viene.","Speaker 1"
"181470","181810"," Viene.","Speaker 1"
"182310","183230"," They come?","Speaker 1"
"184730","185330"," Vienen.","Speaker 1"
"185750","186390"," You informal?","Speaker 1"
"188010","188610"," Vienes.","Speaker 1"
"188770","188970"," We?","Speaker 1"
"190610","191210"," Venimos.","Speaker 1"
"191590","192130"," Venimos.","Speaker 1"
"192270","192770"," Venimos.","Speaker 1"
"193410","193810"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"194150","198070"," So we have this GOT popping up just for the I form.","Speaker 1"
"198630","200310"," We've seen other verbs like this.","Speaker 1"
"200330","201750"," What was to go out or to leave?","Speaker 1"
"203150","203870"," Salir.","Speaker 1"
"204170","204490"," Salir.","Speaker 1"
"204910","206290"," And I go out or I leave?","Speaker 1"
"207850","208490"," Salgo.","Speaker 1"
"208670","209210"," Salgo.","Speaker 1"
"209850","210650"," To put?","Speaker 1"
"212740","213240"," Poner.","Speaker 2"
"213440","214000"," Poner.","Speaker 1"
"214140","214840"," And I put?","Speaker 1"
"216600","217060"," Pongo.","Speaker 1"
"217360","217720"," Pongo.","Speaker 1"
"218120","218480"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"218860","225740"," We have decir, to say or to tell and we get digo which is even more irregular but we see the GO.","Speaker 1"
"226320","231620"," We have hacer, to make or to do and we get hago.","Speaker 1"
"232620","235580"," Oir which means to hear.","Speaker 1"
"236540","239480"," And we have oigo, I hear.","Speaker 1"
"240200","240700"," Traer.","Speaker 1"
"241060","242840"," Traer means to bring.","Speaker 1"
"243620","245180"," And I bring is traigo.","Speaker 1"
"245700","249380"," So to bring is traer traer.","Speaker 1"
"249760","252500"," And then I is traigo.","Speaker 1"
"252660","253600"," It takes an extra I.","Speaker 1"
"253980","255160"," So here we get traigo.","Speaker 1"
"255660","259140"," Traer is interesting because traer means to bring.","Speaker 1"
"259459","264760"," But when it forms part of another verb we can translate it like tract.","Speaker 1"
"265560","268420"," For example, extraer means?","Speaker 1"
"269920","270680"," Extract.","Speaker 1"
"270900","271240"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"271340","272260"," How would you say attract?","Speaker 1"
"273520","274260"," Atraer.","Speaker 2"
"274360","274940"," Atraer.","Speaker 1"
"275320","275860"," Contract?","Speaker 1"
"277520","278160"," Contraer.","Speaker 2"
"278380","279000"," Distract?","Speaker 1"
"280500","281140"," Distraer.","Speaker 2"
"281260","281520"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"281660","282360"," I distract?","Speaker 1"
"284220","284860"," Distraigo.","Speaker 1"
"285280","285920"," Distraigo.","Speaker 1"
"286160","286940"," I distract.","Speaker 1"
"287260","289080"," Or you could say I get distracted.","Speaker 1"
"289480","290260"," Me distraigo.","Speaker 1"
"290600","290960"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"291540","301620"," So these GO verbs are a little bit special and they behave quite irregularly but more or less in the same way.","Speaker 1"
"302160","317040"," One of the things they do in the same way is that in the mood tense, instead of switching vowels like the rest of the verbs do in the mood tense in the present, they go from GO to GA.","Speaker 1"
"317400","328300"," So whilst in the normal present this GO only pops up for I, we have tengo, tiene, tienes, tienen, tenemos, the GA for the mood tense is for everybody.","Speaker 1"
"328720","332480"," So we get tenga for I, he, she, it and you, formal.","Speaker 1"
"333080","334280"," How would you make it informal?","Speaker 1"
"336260","336940"," Tengas.","Speaker 2"
"337260","337720"," Exactly.","Speaker 1"
"338240","346320"," So if you were to say I want you to come, I want that you come speaking informally.","Speaker 1"
"346840","348220"," So I want that?","Speaker 1"
"349520","350300"," Quiero que.","Speaker 2"
"350600","350900"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"351000","354740"," Now we want you come and we want the mood tense version.","Speaker 1"
"355160","356800"," So it's a GO verb.","Speaker 1"
"357160","359600"," So our base for the mood tense is venga.","Speaker 1"
"359880","364580"," So if you want to speak informally and say I want that you come, I want you to come.","Speaker 1"
"366300","368020"," Quiero que vengas.","Speaker 1"
"368140","368680"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"368880","369800"," Quiero que vengas.","Speaker 1"
"370040","373900"," And you will hear actually in Spain venga, venga, venga.","Speaker 1"
"374020","377020"," They use it all the time meaning come on, come on.","Speaker 1"
"377360","377960"," Venga, vale.","Speaker 1"
"378160","380220"," They say vale as well in Spain.","Speaker 1"
"380340","380900"," Venga, vale.","Speaker 1"
"381300","384960"," You will hear this all the time when a Spanish person is hanging up the telephone.","Speaker 1"
"385080","386300"," You can hear 15 of them.","Speaker 1"
"386720","388480"," Venga, vale, vale, venga, venga, vale.","Speaker 1"
"388880","395620"," So this venga that you will hear around a lot will be a nice hook to remember that this GO goes to GA.","Speaker 1"
"396160","402000"," Actually when somebody is answering the phone in Spain you might hear diga or digame.","Speaker 1"
"402500","403220"," What does that mean?","Speaker 1"
"403460","403920"," Digame.","Speaker 1"
"405240","405740"," Tell me.","Speaker 2"
"405880","408520"," Yes, the mood tense by itself is an order.","Speaker 1"
"409060","412620"," For a positive order then we have the ME after the verb digame.","Speaker 1"
"413100","416280"," So you will hear people answering the phone like this in Spain.","Speaker 1"
"416400","417500"," Tell me, digame.","Speaker 1"
"418440","420080"," So traer was to bring.","Speaker 1"
"420720","421580"," What is I bring?","Speaker 1"
"423560","424080"," Traigo.","Speaker 1"
"424300","424820"," Traigo.","Speaker 1"
"425000","427040"," And what is you bring speaking informally?","Speaker 1"
"428760","429280"," Traigas.","Speaker 1"
"429560","433080"," This is the mood tense but we don't want the mood tense.","Speaker 1"
"433620","435680"," We just want you bring informally.","Speaker 1"
"437360","437880"," Traes.","Speaker 1"
"438040","438560"," Traes.","Speaker 1"
"438760","439020"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"439480","443500"," But if you say I want you to bring it, how would you say that?","Speaker 1"
"443800","445680"," I want you to bring it informally.","Speaker 1"
"449900","450280"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"452980","455040"," I don't want you to distract me.","Speaker 1"
"455520","457620"," I don't want you to distract me.","Speaker 1"
"457800","458600"," Still informal.","Speaker 1"
"460000","463620"," No quiero que me distraigas.","Speaker 2"
"463820","464520"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"464780","467580"," No quiero que me distraigas.","Speaker 1"
"467900","470440"," I don't want you to distract me.","Speaker 1"
"470980","471480"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
