"200590","201710"," Lo rompian.","Speaker 1"
"201930","202530"," So what was to break?","Speaker 1"
"202550","222710"," We have the same endings for would And for the line in the past for er, ir verbs The big difference of course is that for would we are adding on to the to form of the verb And for the past we're taking off our endings first, which means we get pairs like comeria I would eat.","Speaker 1"
"222930","224210"," Comia I was eating.","Speaker 1"
"224950","226850"," Romperia I would break.","Speaker 1"
"227190","230890"," Rompia I was breaking So, how would you say it breaks?","Speaker 1"
"230890","241030"," It breaks and you mean it gets broken it breaks itself in the present tense Se rompe.","Speaker 1"
"241250","242010"," Se rompe.","Speaker 1"
"242210","244330"," How would you say it's going to break?","Speaker 1"
"244790","258579"," It's going to break How is we are going or let's go Vamos It is going to break Se va a romper.","Speaker 1"
"258740","259079"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"259380","274860"," Se va a romper or va a romperse So this means it's going to break It's going to get broken And there we're not waiting to hear what it's going to break because we have se So we completed that structure.","Speaker 1"
"274980","286240"," We completed the sentence with se The word for how In spanish is como if you want to ask somebody in spanish How do you say?","Speaker 1"
"287020","300720"," So maybe you have a spanish-speaking friend that speaks english and you want to use them like a dictionary and say how do you say x y or z What you will say in spanish is how does it say itself?","Speaker 1"
"301580","302820"," How is it said?","Speaker 1"
"303040","304320"," How does it say itself?","Speaker 1"
"305120","312820"," So this is another example of where you might be using this Structure of self which we are seeing in spanish is very flexible.","Speaker 1"
"313040","331420"," It's giving us many different meanings this structure of myself yourself ourselves itself this structure So it says from the seer is dice It's a little bit irregular, but then the other versions follow so we have dice for he she it or stead How would you say?","Speaker 1"
"332060","345120"," you in formal say This is good and they say Decent and as we know the we form tends to escape the irregularity As the accent is somewhere else.","Speaker 1"
"345240","354480"," So we go back to this here and to say we say Good so, how would you say how is it said?","Speaker 1"
"354620","355720"," How does it say itself?","Speaker 1"
"359120","366160"," So you you will use this often you don't say commodities this means how do you as an individual say how do you say it?","Speaker 1"
"366420","368080"," If you want to say, how is it said?","Speaker 1"
"368360","370920"," How does it say itself?","Speaker 1"
"371940","374180"," So se is doing quite a lot in spanish","Speaker 1"
"374720","380600"," Sometimes we're using it to wrap up the sentence to show that we're not using a verb","Speaker 1"
"380600","387500"," To anybody or to anything else like in it breaks or it transforms these examples that we saw","Speaker 1"
"388560","393060"," sometimes the say is changing the meaning like between quedar remain or","Speaker 1"
"393060","399980"," Be left over and quedarse to stay and sometimes this set has quite a creative application","Speaker 1"
"399980","403340"," It sells itself for sale","Speaker 1"
"403940","410920"," Or we could even have se habla se habla espanol spanish speaks itself spanish is spoken","Speaker 1"
"410920","412340"," spanish spoken","Speaker 1"
"414200","416620"," By itself means to remain","Speaker 1"
"417040","421580"," And you can use this in the sense of I have one left","Speaker 1"
"421580","426100"," In spanish you will say it remains to me one.","Speaker 1"
"426340","430400"," This is the structure in spanish I have one left it remains to me one.","Speaker 1"
"430640","431540"," So how would you say that?","Speaker 1"
"431740","432640"," I have one left.","Speaker 1"
"432720","433660"," What is the word for one?","Speaker 1"
"435820","469230"," If you're talking about a feminine thing, so I have one left it remains to me one That means I stay one So there you made the reflexive structure you said I remain myself and you got the meaning of to stay But what you want is it remains I have one left I have two left if make it a uno is it remains to me one.","Speaker 1"
"469350","494810"," I have one left How do you think you would say I have two left the word for two is dos Dos related to duo so I have two left they remain to me too Very good, and of course we have the day form of the verb because it's they remain As i'm saying they remain through me through me.","Speaker 1"
"494970","498750"," How do you think it would be if you wanted to say he has two left?","Speaker 1"
"504670","506690"," Two of them they remain to him","Speaker 1"
"506690","512429"," He has two left or she has two left or you form will have two left","Speaker 1"
"512429","517890"," So maybe if you go to a shop and you ask for something and uh, there's none left","Speaker 1"
"517890","521510"," Maybe they will say no, I don't have any left","Speaker 1"
"522909","526410"," You will hear both just depending on what the person has in their mind","Speaker 1"
"526410","530070"," I have none left as in one I have none left as in they've all gone","Speaker 1"
"530070","531990"," No me queda, no me quedan","Speaker 1"
"532630","538490"," But we saw that with this verb then when we use this reflexive structure this self structure","Speaker 1"
"538490","544950"," We get a different meaning if I say I remain myself then I get the meaning of to stay I stay","Speaker 1"
"544950","546630"," So, how is I remain myself?","Speaker 1"
"548870","552150"," Good we remain ourselves","Speaker 1"
"556270","560050"," Good he remains himself or she remains herself","Speaker 1"
"563070","564550"," They stay","Speaker 1"
"567230","575390"," Good, uh, it's all of those that begin with l law la los las all become se for the self version","Speaker 1"
"575390","580790"," From ablar to speak if you want to say I was speaking he was speaking","Speaker 1"
"583180","589460"," Ablava ablava, so we have abba as our key sound for the line in the past for adverbs","Speaker 1"
"590340","591700"," They were speaking","Speaker 1"
"594280","598460"," Good so, how would you say they were staying they were remaining themselves?","Speaker 1"
"602160","656780"," Good they weren't staying here Good I wasn't staying here So abba works for I he she And we were staying here The accent stays We weren't staying here No Good now if you wanted to say we didn't have any left So here what we will say is it didn't or they didn't we have the option remain to us Good Good","Speaker 1"
