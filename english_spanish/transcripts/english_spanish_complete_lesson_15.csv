"1220","2940"," What was the word for what?","Speaker 1"
"4840","5060"," Que.","Speaker 2"
"5320","5580"," Que.","Speaker 1"
"5880","8160"," And you remember how was to pass?","Speaker 1"
"9640","10260"," Is it pasar?","Speaker 1"
"10600","11120"," Pasar.","Speaker 1"
"11360","16020"," And this can also mean like to happen, to pass in the sense of to occur.","Speaker 1"
"16860","18380"," How do you say he passes?","Speaker 1"
"20860","21220"," Passo.","Speaker 2"
"21380","21680"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"21800","22760"," And she passes?","Speaker 1"
"24480","25000"," Passo.","Speaker 2"
"25180","25980"," And it passes?","Speaker 1"
"26460","26900"," Passo.","Speaker 2"
"27080","32300"," Good, and if you want to say what passes, meaning what happens, what's going on, what is happening?","Speaker 1"
"33960","35980"," Ah, I remembered it now.","Speaker 2"
"36160","39540"," I went through the whole process and I remember people saying que paso.","Speaker 2"
"40460","41800"," Ah, this is the past.","Speaker 1"
"42120","49020"," We said that when you emphasize that o on the end, it's actually the version for he, she, it in the past.","Speaker 1"
"49140","52600"," So que paso is what happened and we will look at this later.","Speaker 1"
"52720","54340"," But what, what's happening?","Speaker 1"
"54540","55260"," What is happening?","Speaker 1"
"56260","57060"," Que pasa.","Speaker 1"
"57360","57660"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"58280","62400"," So if you want to say I want to know what's going on, I want to know what's happening.","Speaker 1"
"62540","63860"," I want to know what's passing.","Speaker 1"
"65960","68400"," Quiero saber que pasa.","Speaker 1"
"68680","69800"," Quiero saber que pasa.","Speaker 1"
"70260","71580"," I want to know what's happening.","Speaker 1"
"72460","72980"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"73440","81560"," There's one more thing we need to know about the present and it's gonna fill in happily a grey area for us, which you might be wondering already.","Speaker 1"
"82040","83600"," How did we get tiene?","Speaker 1"
"83600","92540"," He, she, it, you, formal, has or have, and then the other versions tienen, tienes, from tener.","Speaker 1"
"93760","94940"," Tu want is querer.","Speaker 1"
"95640","96840"," What is I want?","Speaker 1"
"98080","98580"," Quiero.","Speaker 2"
"98820","99260"," Quiero.","Speaker 1"
"99820","102360"," So how does querer become quiero?","Speaker 1"
"103140","109200"," So there's something else we need to know about the present to understand this and then we can manage the present completely.","Speaker 1"
"109200","132640"," So what's happening is that when we have an E in the true form of the verb, like in tener, to have, like in querer, to want, when we have an E inside of the verb, that's part of the root, not part of the ending, not that er, that doesn't count, but the e in ten and the e in quer, of querer.","Speaker 1"
"133380","138080"," When we stress it, when we emphasise it, it often splits.","Speaker 1"
"138380","146060"," Most of the time, it splits into an IE under the stress of that accent.","Speaker 1"
"146680","151860"," Under the stress, when we say querer, we have the accent on the end, we have the accent on the ending.","Speaker 1"
"152080","160440"," Then when we take off that er, we put o, we would have quiero, but when we stress down that E, it splits and it becomes quiero.","Speaker 1"
"160440","162280"," The same for tener.","Speaker 1"
"162680","171320"," We would have tener, for he has, but when we stress down on that E, it splits and it becomes tiene.","Speaker 1"
"171820","172860"," The same for come.","Speaker 1"
"173560","183360"," We have venir, but when we say he comes, she comes, it comes, you formal come, it would be bene, but it becomes biene.","Speaker 1"
"183680","188120"," Now it's not happening with tengo or vengo because we can say the N and the G kind of holds it up.","Speaker 1"
"188120","192140"," So this is probably why it got saved, but otherwise it splits.","Speaker 1"
"192760","202560"," Now this might seem quite of a abstract thing to get your head around, but what is very helpful is that we have this between words in English and Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"202800","206100"," We can identify this between words in English and Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"206340","213180"," For example, we have a word that we use for time in English, but only in music.","Speaker 1"
"213940","214960"," Do you know what is this word?","Speaker 1"
"214960","217860"," A word we use for time, but only in music.","Speaker 1"
"217940","224420"," When you speak about the time, the rhythm of music, you talk about its beat, not beat, but tempo.","Speaker 1"
"225820","228600"," Now time in Spanish is tiempo.","Speaker 1"
"229260","236880"," You see the difference between tempo and tiempo, other than the Spanish pronunciation, is that the E has split into AE.","Speaker 1"
"237660","240740"," So you can even see it between words in English and Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"242040","246880"," Concert in Spanish is trying to do the same thing.","Speaker 1"
"248960","252580"," Good, you stuck an O to make it sound more Spanish and you split that E.","Speaker 1"
"254100","256100"," Novembre is noviembre.","Speaker 1"
"256740","257980"," So this will help us remember.","Speaker 1"
"258880","260720"," So this happens most of the time.","Speaker 1"
"260800","262560"," We already saw places it doesn't happen.","Speaker 1"
"262660","267840"," We saw very briefly the verb llegar, which was to arrive, and we said llego, I arrive.","Speaker 1"
"267840","271900"," We saw esperar, which was to wait or to hope, espero.","Speaker 1"
"272380","275080"," It's not happening, but most of the time it's going to happen.","Speaker 1"
"275800","284860"," We saw it happening with tener, which became tiene, he, she, it, you, former, tienen, they, or you plural, tienes, you informal.","Speaker 1"
"285720","290060"," We saw it happening with venir, to come, viene, bienes, vienen.","Speaker 1"
"291060","293220"," Another verb that we see this with is pensar.","Speaker 1"
"293660","295060"," What do you think pensar means?","Speaker 1"
"296960","297460"," Thoughtful.","Speaker 1"
"298040","298640"," But it's a verb.","Speaker 1"
"298760","300300"," There's no verb to thoughtful, is there?","Speaker 1"
"302700","303740"," Well, to think.","Speaker 2"
"303900","305400"," Yes, that's it, to think.","Speaker 1"
"305840","309290"," It's very useful for us to group words into families.","Speaker 1"
"309960","311620"," So verb is a family.","Speaker 1"
"312360","321180"," So when you decide what type of word it is, then you narrow down the possible behaviours of that word and you manage to manage it much easier.","Speaker 1"
"321180","326140"," And making that very clearly, that connection, is really, really helpful for you to think, pensar.","Speaker 1"
"326880","330180"," So if you say, I think, how is it going to be?","Speaker 1"
"332040","332540"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"333320","340660"," It would be penso, but you stress down on that E and it splits into IE and you get pienso, pienso.","Speaker 1"
"341240","345360"," How is he thinks or she thinks or it thinks or informal?","Speaker 1"
"348320","350200"," This sounds like a vowel harmony.","Speaker 1"
"350200","356540"," I mean, it sounds nice, piense, because we have IE and then we want to put an E next to it because it matches.","Speaker 1"
"357500","358500"," But that's Turkish grammar.","Speaker 1"
"359680","364160"," You must know where you are with any verb and to know where you are, you must go back to the true form.","Speaker 1"
"364340","365040"," Then you are confident.","Speaker 1"
"368920","372040"," So you must go back there and then you feel confident.","Speaker 1"
"372400","375940"," Otherwise, the base is going to affect what vowel you want to put on.","Speaker 1"
"377440","377920"," Piensa.","Speaker 2"
"379500","380120"," You informal?","Speaker 1"
"382540","383020"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"383240","383860"," What do you think?","Speaker 1"
"388110","394930"," This is a useful verb as well, actually, because if you say, I think to eat, it means I plan on eating.","Speaker 1"
"395690","397290"," You can say, I think to eat.","Speaker 1"
"397430","398070"," That's simple.","Speaker 1"
"398450","399290"," I think to eat.","Speaker 1"
"399370","400030"," How would it sound?","Speaker 1"
"401850","403030"," Pienso comer.","Speaker 1"
"403490","404170"," Pienso comer.","Speaker 1"
"404430","408150"," I think to eat later is I plan on eating later.","Speaker 1"
"408330","409990"," So how would you say I plan on eating later?","Speaker 1"
"413790","422870"," That means I plan on eating late, which is fine, but later is more late and more is related to massive.","Speaker 1"
"424210","424810"," Mas tarde.","Speaker 2"
"425050","425210"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"425610","426830"," Pienso comer mas tarde.","Speaker 1"
"427090","428250"," I plan on eating later.","Speaker 1"
"428250","429890"," So you can use it like that as well.","Speaker 1"
"430670","433690"," We saw venir, also splits with the exception of vengo.","Speaker 1"
"434250","436290"," He comes, she comes, you informal.","Speaker 1"
"436930","437770"," How would that be?","Speaker 1"
"439370","439850"," They?","Speaker 1"
"443850","444810"," You informal?","Speaker 1"
"446990","447470"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"447670","448870"," Do you remember how was when?","Speaker 1"
"451610","452650"," When are you coming?","Speaker 1"
"455730","457050"," ¿Cuánto vienes?","Speaker 1"
"458090","458750"," Entender.","Speaker 1"
"459070","460890"," Entender means to understand.","Speaker 1"
"461690","464090"," You can use comprender if you forget it.","Speaker 1"
"464470","465430"," But entender is better.","Speaker 1"
"465690","466330"," It's more common.","Speaker 1"
"466870","469770"," But comprender is easier because it sounds like comprehend.","Speaker 1"
"470530","472850"," And also in comprender, the E doesn't split.","Speaker 1"
"473610","475790"," I understand is comprendo.","Speaker 1"
"476270","478930"," But with entender, it does split.","Speaker 1"
"478930","485370"," So you can use comprender, but most common in Spanish is entender for understand.","Speaker 1"
"485810","487150"," And here the E does split.","Speaker 1"
"487450","488810"," So how would you say I understand?","Speaker 1"
"493690","496210"," How would you say he understands?","Speaker 1"
"500090","500810"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"501210","501330"," They?","Speaker 1"
"506010","508210"," Perder means to lose.","Speaker 1"
"508210","510970"," It's kind of related to perish.","Speaker 1"
"511590","512909"," There is a connection there.","Speaker 1"
"513110","514370"," Or perishable food.","Speaker 1"
"514570","516390"," You know, food that is, that rots.","Speaker 1"
"516870","517669"," Not real food.","Speaker 1"
"518190","520270"," I lose?","Speaker 1"
"523049","523690"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"523850","524970"," The process is perder.","Speaker 1"
"525390","526970"," Perdo, maybe it splits.","Speaker 1"
"527730","528370"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"529070","529810"," I lose it?","Speaker 1"
"533230","533870"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"534110","534850"," I lose them?","Speaker 1"
"536130","537430"," Los pierdo.","Speaker 2"
"537590","538290"," Los pierdo.","Speaker 1"
"538530","538750"," Good.","Speaker 1"
