"1160","5680"," So again, you're staying here, let's make that, you're staying here, informal.","Speaker 1"
"8200","9360"," Te quedas aquí.","Speaker 1"
"9540","10660"," Good, te quedas aquí.","Speaker 1"
"11020","12260"," You're not staying here.","Speaker 1"
"13540","14960"," No te quedas aquí.","Speaker 1"
"15260","17500"," No te quedas aquí, or acá.","Speaker 1"
"17960","21240"," Now, if you want to make that a question, aren't you staying here?","Speaker 1"
"22580","23900"," No te quedas aquí.","Speaker 1"
"24000","25440"," Good, no te quedas aquí.","Speaker 1"
"25600","26840"," Why aren't you staying here?","Speaker 1"
"28060","29500"," ¿Por qué no te quedas aquí?","Speaker 1"
"29600","30080"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"30080","32740"," What was I go or I'm going?","Speaker 1"
"33280","34320"," I'm going on a voyage.","Speaker 1"
"35740","36020"," Voy.","Speaker 1"
"36180","36980"," Voy, good.","Speaker 1"

"44180","45980"," Voy a quedarme.","Speaker 2"
"46120","49080"," Good, until seven, until seven o'clock.","Speaker 1"
"49180","53420"," Seven is siete, similar to the beginning of September.","Speaker 1"
"54240","58760"," September in Spanish actually is either Septiembre or Setiembre.","Speaker 1"
"58760","69960"," You have two versions of it in Spanish, Septiembre with the P or without the P, Septiembre, and you can see how siete is like the beginning set with the split of the E.","Speaker 1"
"70360","75560"," So I'm going to stay, I'm going to remain myself until seven o'clock.","Speaker 1"
"75760","78080"," I'm going to stay until seven o'clock.","Speaker 1"
"79740","83480"," Voy a quedarme hasta las siete.","Speaker 2"
"83700","86680"," Good, voy a quedarme hasta las siete.","Speaker 1"
"86860","87360"," Very good.","Speaker 1"
"87360","89180"," How do you say, I want to stay?","Speaker 1"
"91580","92700"," Quiero quedarme.","Speaker 1"

"94400","95580"," Do you want to stay?","Speaker 1"
"95800","97020"," Let's talk informally.","Speaker 1"
"97400","98380"," Do you want to stay?","Speaker 1"
"100800","101920"," ¿Quieres quedarte?","Speaker 2"
"102140","103340"," Good, very good.","Speaker 1"
"103560","104580"," ¿Quieres quedarte?","Speaker 1"
"104740","106420"," Do you want to remain yourself?","Speaker 1"
"107320","109200"," What was I must or I owe?","Speaker 1"
"110840","111400"," Debo.","Speaker 1"
"111600","112540"," Debo, good.","Speaker 1"
"112960","116760"," What is we owe or we must?","Speaker 1"
"117260","120720"," And the two-form is deber, deber, to owe.","Speaker 1"
"121340","121760"," So we?","Speaker 1"
"124040","124680"," Susdebemos.","Speaker 1"
"124880","127360"," Good, we must stay.","Speaker 1"
"127919","132200"," So we owe to remain ourselves, we must stay.","Speaker 1"
"135750","138790"," Debemos quedarme, quedarnos.","Speaker 2"
"139090","140830"," Good, debemos quedarnos.","Speaker 1"
"141250","144090"," Of course, this nos or me or te can come at the beginning as well.","Speaker 1"
"144510","146670"," Nos debemos quedar, debemos quedarnos.","Speaker 1"
"147250","147530"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"147530","150110"," What was I have in the sense of possession?","Speaker 1"
"150990","153130"," So no haber, the other have.","Speaker 1"
"154050","154430"," Tengo.","Speaker 1"
"154710","155110"," Tengo.","Speaker 1"
"155550","164370"," So if we add on que to tengo, we get the meaning of have to, which is just like debo, but less serious sounding, just like in English.","Speaker 1"
"164690","168830"," I must stay sounds a little bit more serious than I have to stay.","Speaker 1"
"169090","174030"," And that difference in register, how it feels is the same in Spanish.","Speaker 1"
"175050","176770"," So how would you say, I have to stay?","Speaker 1"
"178270","180650"," Tengo que quedarme.","Speaker 2"

"204490","205430"," I want to know.","Speaker 1"
"205430","207490"," First bit, don't think about the whole sentence.","Speaker 1"
"207630","209190"," Just think of I want.","Speaker 1"

"213330","214010"," Quiero saber.","Speaker 1"
"214290","215130"," Now forget that bit.","Speaker 1"
"215490","215810"," Why?","Speaker 1"
"216910","217350"," Porque?","Speaker 2"
"217590","218710"," You have to stay here.","Speaker 1"

"261890","262110"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"262330","264490"," No puedo quedarme esta noche.","Speaker 1"
"264930","267130"," The two form of can is poder.","Speaker 1"
"267530","267930"," Poder.","Speaker 1"
"268030","271710"," And this always splitting when we stress it and say puedo.","Speaker 1"
"272090","272690"," Poder.","Speaker 1"
"273130","276110"," So how would you say we can or we are able?","Speaker 1"

"363100","366140"," I don't want you to guess and see where it feels good.","Speaker 1"
"366600","368620"," So with logic, you want to place it.","Speaker 1"
"368660","369580"," And if you're wrong, it's fine.","Speaker 1"
"369820","374440"," Because if you got there through a thought and logic, you will change the logic through that mistake.","Speaker 1"
"375200","377780"," So tell me the rule about where that me can go.","Speaker 1"
"378660","383260"," It goes after the to form and before everything else.","Speaker 2"
"383500","384920"," Before the changed verb.","Speaker 1"
"385400","388240"," It's very important the way we instruct ourselves.","Speaker 1"
"388860","394680"," Now, I'm giving you always the simplest way that we can instruct ourselves accurately.","Speaker 1"
"394980","399620"," If I tell you before the verb and you tell yourself at the beginning, you lose something.","Speaker 1"
"400340","401980"," You lose a certain clarity.","Speaker 1"
"402260","405140"," Yeah, because nouns might come into the sentence and then.","Speaker 2"
"405300","405740"," Exactly.","Speaker 1"
"406240","407420"," We have stayed.","Speaker 1"
"407680","409200"," We have remained ourselves.","Speaker 1"

"433760","434680"," Make it a question.","Speaker 1"
"434680","435820"," Have you stayed?","Speaker 1"
"438340","438580"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"438920","440300"," And let's be emphatic now.","Speaker 1"
"441080","442300"," Let's say the word for you.","Speaker 1"
"445280","445860"," Good.","Speaker 2"
"447040","449040"," Let's make it negative now.","Speaker 1"
"449700","450900"," Haven't you stayed?","Speaker 1"
"455000","455720"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"457260","457980"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"459820","464480"," In Spanish is to call or to phone, to telephone.","Speaker 1"
"464480","471380"," Llamar, LL, which we said is pronounced like Y in most of Spanish speaking world, to call.","Speaker 1"
"471780","473900"," How do you say I call?","Speaker 1"
"475700","484180"," If you want to introduce yourself, instead of saying my name is in Spanish, it's much more common to say I call myself.","Speaker 1"
"487370","488940"," And then you can introduce yourself.","Speaker 1"
"489400","491240"," For example.","Speaker 1"
"492060","494060"," How would you say you call yourself?","Speaker 1"
"495040","495520"," Informal.","Speaker 1"
"497640","498100"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"498600","502900"," If you want to ask the name, you will say, how do you call yourself?","Speaker 1"
"503260","505620"," And the word for how is como.","Speaker 1"
"506920","509740"," So how do you say, how do you call yourself?","Speaker 1"
"512980","513400"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"514380","520600"," You might've heard this around and not understood actually how it's being constructed and now we understand it.","Speaker 1"
"520740","522320"," It's how do you call yourself?","Speaker 1"
