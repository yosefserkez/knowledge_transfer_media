"27860","30140"," So we have i and io.","Speaker 1"
"30800","39020"," So if we go to comer, to eat, I ate is comi, and he ate, she ate, it ate, you formal ate is comio.","Speaker 1"
"40020","45520"," We're accenting the endings again, the I and the O, comi, comio.","Speaker 1"
"46100","47840"," Comi, comio.","Speaker 1"
"48040","48420"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"49180","50760"," What was salir, salir?","Speaker 1"
"52800","53460"," To leave.","Speaker 1"
"53600","55080"," To leave or to go out.","Speaker 1"
"55440","58240"," So how would you say, I went out or I left?","Speaker 1"
"61120","63000"," She went out, she left.","Speaker 1"
"65580","66140"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"66480","69320"," She didn't go out yet, she didn't leave yet.","Speaker 1"
"72820","73200"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"75220","79720"," I don't know why she didn't leave yet, I don't know why she didn't leave yet.","Speaker 1"
"85080","85440"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"88560","90620"," What did que mean?","Speaker 1"
"90980","92020"," Que, what does that mean?","Speaker 1"
"92880","93180"," What.","Speaker 1"
"93820","94500"," Yes, what.","Speaker 1"
"94640","95820"," And what else does it mean?","Speaker 1"
"96780","97100"," That.","Speaker 1"
"97560","97960"," That.","Speaker 1"
"98360","101260"," In like, I hope that, espero que.","Speaker 1"
"101740","102020"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"102880","108860"," So apart from what and that, que also means than, than.","Speaker 1"
"109060","110500"," So you can use it like this.","Speaker 1"
"110500","115560"," So you could say, for example, I ate more than him.","Speaker 1"
"116160","118060"," I ate, is the first thing.","Speaker 1"
"120600","121920"," And here the verb.","Speaker 1"
"123320","123920"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"124060","125440"," I ate more than him.","Speaker 1"
"130960","131560"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"132100","134600"," Not him, than he, more than he ate.","Speaker 1"
"135280","139540"," Comí más que él, I ate more than him or more than he ate.","Speaker 1"
"139540","140540"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"141540","142680"," He ate more than me.","Speaker 1"
"144240","148780"," Comío, más, que, and I'm not sure if it's me or migo.","Speaker 2"
"149380","156720"," When we said comí más que él, we put él there because whilst in English we say him, what we really mean is he.","Speaker 1"
"157040","158660"," I ate more than he ate.","Speaker 1"
"158900","162180"," It's quite peculiar in English that we say him and not he.","Speaker 1"
"163040","164920"," So in Spanish we're being more literal.","Speaker 1"
"165340","168460"," Comí más que él, I ate more than he.","Speaker 1"
"168460","170540"," So, he ate more than me.","Speaker 1"
"170920","173140"," Comío más que yo.","Speaker 1"
"173520","173640"," Exactly.","Speaker 1"
"174600","175800"," So he ate more than I.","Speaker 1"
"175900","177600"," He ate more than I ate.","Speaker 1"
"178180","179040"," So how would that be?","Speaker 1"
"181120","183380"," Comío más que yo.","Speaker 2"
"183560","183840"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"184040","185680"," Comío más que yo.","Speaker 1"
"186240","189200"," It's actually quite peculiar in English that we say me.","Speaker 1"
"189640","200200"," In fact, the way we use words like me instead of I is very peculiar in English and it's a negative language transfer that could influence other languages that you're learning.","Speaker 1"
"200400","203780"," For example, if I say, who wants to go to the park?","Speaker 1"
"204080","204980"," You might say, me.","Speaker 1"
"206240","207620"," This doesn't make any sense.","Speaker 1"
"208080","208560"," It's I.","Speaker 1"
"208860","210240"," I want to go to the park.","Speaker 1"
"210480","211020"," This is me.","Speaker 1"
"211840","222440"," So there is some strange use of these words in English that might influence our Spanish so we need to cut that negative language transfer when we identify it popping up.","Speaker 1"
"222440","225080"," So, comío más que yo.","Speaker 1"
"225260","226540"," He ate more than I.","Speaker 1"
"226600","227600"," He ate more than I ate.","Speaker 1"
"228380","229240"," What was to see?","Speaker 1"
"231120","231440"," Ver.","Speaker 1"
"231640","231980"," Ver.","Speaker 1"
"232100","232360"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"233000","233680"," I saw.","Speaker 1"
"234440","235820"," Ver is regular here.","Speaker 1"
"236620","237560"," So I saw.","Speaker 1"
"238800","240020"," So go back to comer.","Speaker 1"
"240340","241240"," Use that as your hook.","Speaker 1"
"242520","242720"," Vi.","Speaker 1"
"242960","243160"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"243620","244620"," I saw him.","Speaker 1"
"246320","247040"," Lo vi.","Speaker 1"

"251700","252500"," No lo vi.","Speaker 2"
"252820","253300"," No lo vi.","Speaker 1"
"253860","257540"," I saw him but he didn't see me.","Speaker 1"
"257980","265000"," And as we're contrasting we will probably use one or both of the words for I and he.","Speaker 1"
"265300","266860"," Those words we don't need to use.","Speaker 1"
"266980","269400"," We will probably use one or both of them here as we're contrasting.","Speaker 1"
"269920","270800"," Although you don't need to.","Speaker 1"
"271120","271900"," So it's up to you.","Speaker 1"
"272180","274800"," I saw him but he didn't see me.","Speaker 1"
"274900","276320"," First bit is I saw him.","Speaker 1"
"277740","278380"," Lo vi.","Speaker 2"
"278380","280700"," But he didn't see me.","Speaker 1"
"282320","284660"," Pero no me vio.","Speaker 2"
"285020","285260"," Good.","Speaker 1"
"285740","288900"," Lo vi pero no me vio.","Speaker 1"
"289580","293760"," And like I said as we're contrasting we might feel an urge to say the word for el.","Speaker 1"
"294160","295560"," Lo vi pero el no me vio.","Speaker 1"
"295780","297640"," Or yo lo vi pero el no me vio.","Speaker 1"
"298140","299280"," It depends on the context.","Speaker 1"
"299400","305040"," Even if you have context and you know who you're talking about you might feel yourself wanting to say these words because you're contrasting.","Speaker 1"
"306220","307340"," The word for nothing.","Speaker 1"
"307340","309440"," Nothing in Spanish is nada.","Speaker 1"
"310500","310700"," Nada.","Speaker 2"

"311400","312740"," N-A-D-A.","Speaker 1"
"312960","313180"," Nada.","Speaker 1"
"313600","313860"," Nada.","Speaker 2"
"314280","319760"," And we have double negative in Spanish which means you can say I didn't see nothing.","Speaker 1"
"321970","322950"," No vi nada.","Speaker 1"
"323090","323330"," Good.","Speaker 1"
